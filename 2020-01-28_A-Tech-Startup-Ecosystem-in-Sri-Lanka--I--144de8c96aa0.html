With an Israeli Entrepreneur-turned Angel Investor. Mostly on the question: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“What makes a good tech startup ecosystem?”</strong></p><h3 name="d868" id="d868" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Startup Paradox</h3><p name="5068" id="5068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The ideal tech startup ecosystem is a “support system”. It has everything a startup needs. Funding is available at a reasonable cost. And it has connections to markets and economies.</p><p name="8676" id="8676" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, the ideal tech startup ecosystem becomes a magnet for talent. Not only new entrepreneurs looking for their first wins. But also experienced veterans. Seasoned entrepreneurs who have succeeded elsewhere, often many times. “Knowledge organizations” like universities and research groups, join these people.</p><p name="8353" id="8353" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I could have described many parts of the world. Not all of which are startup hubs. The great startup hubs of the world have something else. And here lies the paradox.</p><p name="a20e" id="a20e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ideal startup ecosystems are “nice places”. Complete with funding, market reach, connections, talent, experience and knowledge. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But invariably, the best startup entrepreneurs tend to come from “not-so-nice places”</strong>. Often places with economic hardship, war and persecution.</p><p name="1c85" id="1c85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Thus, often a startup-hub is not just one place. But two places: the nice place and the not-so-nice-place. The former is the “official startup hub”. While the latter is where many of the entrepreneurs come from.</strong></p><figure name="2ae8" id="2ae8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Qztwn7tSytn9wkaVUVrTRQ.png" data-width="720" data-height="400" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qztwn7tSytn9wkaVUVrTRQ.png"></figure><h3 name="0ede" id="0ede" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Nice-places and not-so-nice-places</h3><h4 name="c612" id="c612" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Silicon Valley (SV) Type</h4><p name="d11e" id="d11e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Silicon value has all the “nice” properties of a startup hub, from almost infinite funding, to broad market reach. However, a disproportionate number of successful SV startups have been founded by immigrants from “not-so-nice-places”. Russia has been, for several years, the “not-so-nice-place” of choice. Followed by China and India. In fact, there is an SV joke that no startup is complete without a Russin-Jewish co-founder.</p><p name="5304" id="5304" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This dynamic is also true for other parts of the US like New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. And many European cities like London, Berlin and Paris.</p><h4 name="3de6" id="3de6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Beijing/Shanghai Type</h4><p name="020f" id="020f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Beijing and Shanghai are fast becoming “nice-places” to rival SV. However, its source of “not-so-nice place”-entrepreneurs has been not Russia, or other parts of the world. But China itself.</p><p name="8a4e" id="8a4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the last couple of decades, China has accelerated from extreme poverty to significant prosperity. But many parts of the country are still relatively poor. Thus, past memories, and present inequalities, motivate people in “not-so-nice” parts of the country to seek prosperity.</p><p name="a7ef" id="a7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bangalore, India also follows this type. Like Beijing and Shanghai, part of the “niceness” is also driven by “returners” particularly from the US.</p><h4 name="2df8" id="2df8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tel-Aviv Type</h4><p name="5c02" id="5c02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Israel’s “not-so-niceness” derives, not from poverty, but from geopolitics and history. Israel’s neighbours want to blow it off the face of the earth. To this end, they have waged many wars. Both military and “diplomatic”. While on the surface Israel might have the “niceness” of a developed country, there is a constant “not-so-nice” threat of destruction. This has driven unparalleled development. Particularly in defence and security technology.</p><h4 name="87ad" id="87ad" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Singapore Type</h4><p name="0e14" id="0e14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Singapore’s “not-so-niceness” comes from its government. Which is, on paper, democratic. But in many ways autocratic. There is a significant amount of pressure applied to all manner of institutions, from universities to companies, to innovate. Particularly technology.</p><h3 name="be83" id="be83" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">More Reflections</h3><p name="c1b1" id="c1b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">None of these “types” is completely single-type. Each is some combination of all four types. The “types” are more an understanding aid.</p><p name="9e5c" id="9e5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Israel and Singapore demonstrate that the “nice place” and the “not-so-nice place” can be one and the same. In a sense, it is more a mindset, than a place.</p><p name="d24c" id="d24c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nice places” often cannot be “not-so-nice places”. Except in exceptional cases like Israel and Singapore. For this reason, there are very few “2nd or 3rd Generation” entrepreneurs in “nice places” like SV. While the first generation has enough memory and experience of “not-so-nice”, their children rarely inherit this motivation.</p><p name="3d98" id="3d98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same place can be “nice” for some people and “not-so-nice” for other people. On the one hand, most of Sri Lanka has been, historically, quite a “nice” place. Basics like food and safe lodging are abundant. On the other hand, parts of the country are much harder to live in. Similarly, some ethnicities and communities have faced more hardships than others. This “not-so-niceness” might have contributed to more entrepreneurship in the said places and groups.</p><h3 name="d1ed" id="d1ed" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Can Sri Lanka Build a Tech Startup Ecosystem?</h3><p name="0885" id="0885" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The Israeli Entrepreneur-turned Early Stage Investor seemed to think not. Why? Sri Lanka, while a “nice enough” place, had almost no supply of “not-so-nice” talent. At least that’s what he thought.</p><p name="235b" id="235b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But is that actually true? Might things change in the future?</p><p name="7376" id="7376" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I will address this in <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-9baa17415ed7" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-9baa17415ed7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Part II</a>.</p></div></div></section>
