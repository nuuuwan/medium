To say “we had a good time” is an understatement. Japan was “Food heaven, Jazz heaven, and (especially relevant to me) Train heaven — all rolled into one”.</p><p name="3624" id="3624" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But beyond this material appreciation, the trip also awakened some spiritual curiosity. I was particularly interested in the following observations.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1586" id="1586" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Non-Individualism. Whether it’s through extreme hospitality and politeness, or through the way that everyone seems to blend in, or through the focus for more collective space at the expense of individual space, Japan seemed a deeply non-individualistic culture.</li><li name="1e4e" id="1e4e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Formalism. From greetings to dress to how train drivers behave, there is a lot of Formalism. This felt less mechanical and scripted, and more a sense of peace and flow.</li><li name="3f5e" id="3f5e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Minimalism. This was obvious not only in art, furniture, food, and design in general, but also in outlook and discussion. A focus on essence, voiding elaboration. An embracing of simplicity and austerity.</li><li name="d1f7" id="d1f7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Quality. Every product and service in Japan seemed to be very high quality. It was difficult to find anything that was 2nd grade of shoddy.</li></ul><p name="a212" id="a212" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Much of this seemed connected and embodied in Japanese Zen Buddhism. I was particularly interested in the concept of Wabi Sabi (侘寂) — which I learnt about after the trip from Marcel Theroux’s <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ2P8z7kYJW0&amp;h=AT1vrx7bL3PNGAdXq5BnbF4UfbLXM6oQVEsUJPqtNTpir7EYkpGz3thpIJj0ePk9rAAQjNoz4lBS25hv1GytPo1xA2fScRCNsnmae8GE9Cyvx0mbrCBQadqf47Rwg95utttnRUnEzd1L7mJ-XEP2xy52" data-href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ2P8z7kYJW0&amp;h=AT1vrx7bL3PNGAdXq5BnbF4UfbLXM6oQVEsUJPqtNTpir7EYkpGz3thpIJj0ePk9rAAQjNoz4lBS25hv1GytPo1xA2fScRCNsnmae8GE9Cyvx0mbrCBQadqf47Rwg95utttnRUnEzd1L7mJ-XEP2xy52" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BBC documentary</a>, and this <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQmHLYhxYVjA&amp;h=AT0GO20AC9uOTGUN-288lLqP1UjYXGw2jClG2bIqzdUjqseIWeX6Cwfm4-nqK5TODNltso4qjBWmFRfYKyITJutXYrgHA-e7Uw1M7zGGh1W-mnjc9tJWJdPivGJCTBOatbcE-CXuTOiPszLUmeSYwjjP" data-href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQmHLYhxYVjA&amp;h=AT0GO20AC9uOTGUN-288lLqP1UjYXGw2jClG2bIqzdUjqseIWeX6Cwfm4-nqK5TODNltso4qjBWmFRfYKyITJutXYrgHA-e7Uw1M7zGGh1W-mnjc9tJWJdPivGJCTBOatbcE-CXuTOiPszLUmeSYwjjP" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener" target="_blank">useful blurb</a> by Alain du Botton. Roughly, Wabi and Sabi are being at peace and appreciating Suffering and Impermanence, respectively.</p><p name="5a8f" id="5a8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the back of my mind, I always felt that there was some <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">common thread</em> linking all these ideas. To say the common thread was “Buddhism” felt partly true, but also felt incomplete. I wanted something more specific.</p><p name="6db0" id="6db0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A couple of days ago, it occurred to me that the following explanation is consistent with the observations:</p><p name="a2b7" id="a2b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Non-Individualism, Formalism, Minimalism, Quality and Wabi Sabi are all connected to living through contemplation, as opposed to living through thought.</em></p><p name="c573" id="c573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I thought about this more, the following contrasts occurred to me.</p><h3 name="7605" id="7605" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Contemplative Life vs. the Thoughtful Life</h3><ol class="postList"><li name="7b3a" id="7b3a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">Thought pursues a specific goal. Contemplation has no specific goal. With thought, the destination is more important than the journey. With contemplation it’s all about the journey.</li><li name="c25a" id="c25a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Thought consists of navigating a large set of ideas, until a single idea is reached. Contemplation consists of focusing on a small set of ideas, or one idea — with repetition. [Minimalism]</li><li name="2db9" id="2db9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">With thought, not only is the journey secondary, a shorter (more “efficient” or “optimal”) journey is considered preferable. The ability to “think quickly” is better. With contemplation, there are no such constraints on the journey.</li><li name="d739" id="d739" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">With thought, success depends on efficiently reaching the destination goal. With contemplation, success depends on the quality of the journey. [Quality]</li><li name="8e0a" id="8e0a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The results of thought are easier to measure, and often possible to define beforehand. It’s difficult to measure and describe the effects of contemplation, and usually impossible to predict.</li><li name="2d8a" id="2d8a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Thought is said to be “creative” — “Creative thought”. Contemplation, on the other hand, often involves, formal, mechanical tasks (e.g. Observing one’s breadth) or formal steps (e.g. walking slowly). These tasks and steps are often scripted and have been used for hundreds of years [Formalism].</li><li name="3697" id="3697" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Paradoxically, often it’s hard to be creative by trying to “think creatively”. More often, mechanical contemplation leads to more creative and better quality results. The subconscious is often better at creativity than the conscious.</li><li name="9b37" id="9b37" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Thought is optimized for “single tasking”. It’s impossible to think of more than one thing at the same time. Switching between different trains of thought (multi-tasking) is tiring. Contemplating involves sub-conscious multi-tasking. The subconscious is good at multi-tasking.</li><li name="a74e" id="a74e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Thinking is always focused on our individual identities — even when we are thinking about something outside ourselves or trying to achieve a non-individualistic goal. Contemplation draws us away from ourselves and is unconstrained by our individualism [Non-individualism].</li><li name="869c" id="869c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">With thought, success and beauty are precision and correctness. A successful result is robust and constant. With contemplation success is transient, impermanent, and ambiguous. It is appreciated while it lasts [Sabi].</li><li name="b3b1" id="b3b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">With thought, there is the constant allure of success; reaching the goal; winning; a perfect destination. There is no such thing with contemplation. There is no goal, and often the journey is difficult, imperfect, and must be peacefully endured [Wabi].</li></ol><h3 name="536f" id="536f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Disclaimers</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="fd39" id="fd39" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">The reader of this note might incorrectly infer that our experience of Japanese culture and society was unanimously positive. This is not the case. Some things we did find alarming, troubling and sometimes disgusting. This note focusses on a subset of our experience; not all of it.</em></li><li name="a838" id="a838" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">This note is inspired by Japan, but not a description of Japan.</em></li><li name="c2bc" id="c2bc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">When it comes to history, philosophy, neuro-science and religion, I’m very much an amateur and layperson.
