RE: Neocortex

What were the engineers who developed the adaptive software actually goaled on? Was it the same (survival) goals as the remaining more primitive parts of the brain, or was it a set of different goals?

My intuition is that the Neocortex is not actually better software, but better hardware. I.e. more RAM, and (possibly) better internal busses.
