### Transport in Sri Lanka

# Is the Colombo Light Rail worth it?

### A very "back-of-the-envelope analysis"

There's a lot of discussion and debate about the recently cancelled, Japanese funded, Colombo Light Rail (CLR) Project. Opponents say that "it is not cost-effective". Proponents have other thoughts.

Who's right? To form an opinion of my own, I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations.

[See also https://medium.com/on-economics/road-metrics-aef58a17f097 for more details on metrics.]

## Latency and Speed

The first stage of the CLR spans 15 stations from Pettah to Malabe. A distance of about 15km. With a top speed of about 80km/h, the CLR promised to complete the entire length in about 30min (average speed 30km/h).

While it is possible to drive from Pettah to Malabe in about 30min in no traffic (e.g. at 2 am), at peak traffic, the journey can last three times that (90min). By bus, it can be 2 hours or more.

Hence, it is clear that the CLR would have been faster. Especially during peak traffic.

## Bandwidth

"Bandwidth" is a measure of the number of people travelling per unit time.

A CLR train has a maximum capacity of about 800 people. Assuming that 15 trains could have run per hour* (or one every 4 minutes), the CLR would have a bandwidth of 3.3 people per second.

A 10m long bus, with a maximum capacity of 60 people, with a bottleneck speed of 5km/h, has a bandwidth of about 8.3 people per second.

A sedan with five passengers has a bandwidth of about 1.4 people per second. However, even at peak-traffic most cars in Sri Lanka have about 2 passengers on average. Hence, bandwidth is about 0.6 people per second.

Hence, on bandwidth, busses are still more efficient than CLR.

[* I don't have the exact figure. Also, see discussion on Cost]

## Comfort

Like many private cars, the CLR will be Air Conditioned. But also like many busses, when at maximum capacity, many passengers might be standing and cramped together.

## Cost per Trip

For simplicity, I only look at upfront costs. I'd assume that upfront costs and ongoing costs are proportional.

The first stage of the CLR will cost about $2.2B or Rs. 407B. Spreading this across 25 years, and ignoring inflation/interest, this would be about Rs. 16B per year. Assuming an average of 250 working days per year*, that's Rs. 65M per day.

Assuming that the CLR runs for 8 hours per day**, at 15 trains per hour***, and 800 passenger trips per train, it completes about 96,000 Trips/Day. Hence, the CLR would (very roughly) cost Rs. 678 /Trip.

In comparison, a Rs. 10M Bus, with a 5-year lifespan, and 240 Trips/Day, would cost about Rs. 33 / Trip.

A private car, costing Rs. 6M, with a 5-year lifespan, with 4 trips per day (2 passengers, to and from work) would cost Rs. 1200/Trip.

If the same car were used as a Taxi, with 30 trips a day, that cost would drop to Rs.160/Trip. Carpooling would be somewhere in between.

[* Assuming 250 working days is equivalent to 365 working and weekend days combined]

[** The train would probably run for about 16 hours per day. I assume it is equivalent to 8 hours at maximum capacity]

[*** I don't know if the $2.2B estimate budgets for this many trains. It might be lower, in which case the CLR would be more expensive than I estimate.]

## Pollution

On the one hand, the CLR would be electric, and hence, compared to petrol cars and diesel buses, would have no urban pollution. On the other hand, Sri Lanka's electricity generation has increasingly depended on coal, the most polluting form of fuel.

Hence, all options pollute, but CLR and Busses probably pollute less per Trip.

## Summary and Concluding Thoughts

As I said, this is very much a "back-of-the-envelope" computation. Hence, season with the obligatory pinch of salt.

In summary, this is how cars, busses and the CLR compared across different dimensions.

My (personal) conclusions are as follows:

* Pollution: No transport option will be environmentally ideal until Sri Lanka can move away from coal.

* Cost/Trip: Busses are the most cost-effective option. CLR and Cars are expensive.

* Comfort: The gap between Busses and Cars can be narrowed by having more ACed busses, and policies around crowding and safety, E.g. Female only busses.

* Bandwidth: Busses are best

* Latency and Speed: The only dimension where the CLR wins convincingly. However, I wonder what would happen if a significant proportion of traffic moves from cars and other private vehicles to busses? That might significantly reduce latency.

Overall, CLR is probably not worth it. The most low-hanging-fruit for Sri Lanka seems to lie in improving Bus Transport. Hence, I think what Sri Lanka needs is, not a Light Rail Plan (CLR or otherwise), but a Bus 2.0 Plan. We need to get people out of cars and into the busses.
