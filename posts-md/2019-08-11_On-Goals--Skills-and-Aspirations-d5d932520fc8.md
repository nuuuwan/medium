An organization must align its employees behind its goals. Everyone should be doing "What they should do".

On the other hand, employees work at the organization to satisfy their needs. For example, they are paid a salary which satisfies their physical and safety needs. They interact within the organization, which might satisfy some of their needs for friendship and esteem. The best organizations might also allow their employees the opportunity to self actualize and grow. In other words, employees work in organizations because they can do (to various extents) "What they want to do".

But finally, all of these must be realistic. On one hand, these align with the skills possessed by the employees, and other the hand, the environment and resources provided by the organization. At the end of the day, people can only do "what they can do".

## What does this mean for organizations?

* Have the right "should do" (Mission, Vision, Strategy, Tactics)

* Hire people who "want to do" (Motivation)

* Hire people who "can do" (Skill)

* Create an environment and provide resources enabling "can do"

## What does this mean for employees?

* Join organizations where you "should do" what you "can do" and what you "want to do"
