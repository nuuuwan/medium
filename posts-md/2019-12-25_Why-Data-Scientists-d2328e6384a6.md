# Why Data Scientists

### On Data Science Super-Powers

Data Scientists are some of the most misunderstood and under-appreciated people in the world. And to the world's cost.

In this article, I hope to help you understand data scientists a bit better.

Disclaimer: While I have some grounding in statistics and statistical machine learning, I'm not a data scientist myself. However, I have been fortunate to have worked with some genuinely world-class data scientists. And this article is based more on my experience of their skills. And less on my own.

## What is Data Science?

Data Science is the science of making sense of data. "Making sense" usually means "Making useful sense". The "Making sense" has to be practical and productive.

"Practical and Productive" usually involve explaining the past, or predicting the future. The problem with data is that all data is "in the present". Even if it might be "about the past" or future. For example, the artefacts in an archaeological site are "in the present" they are not pieces of bone "in 30,000 BCE". They are pieces of bone in 2019, which might be from "30,000 BCE".

Hence, an essential part of Data Science is about making "significant" conclusions about the past or future. Using data, which is always from the present.

## Three Super-Powers

The best data scientists have three super-powers.

### The Past

Data Scientists can use data from the present to make accurate conclusions about the past. Or "significant" conclusions about the past. "Significant" conclusions have a high probability of being correct.

"Insignificant' conclusions, on the other hand, have a high chance of being false. Usually, because there is a better, often more straightforward explanation of the data.

The best data scientists also have an uncanny ability to make counter-intuitive "I never thought of that" type conclusions about the past. These often force us to revise our view of the past.

### The Future

The future is exactly like the past. "Conclusions" about the past are replaced with "Predictions" about the future. These are precisely the same because all the data is about the present. And hence, we might as well "predict" the past, or "conclude" about the future, using this data.

As with the past, the best data scientists find counter-intuitive predictions about the future. They might be able to predict a new trend that no one has thought of. Hence, Data scientists play an essential role in planning roadmaps and the "strategic visions" of organizations.

### Present

Most people are too preoccupied with the future and past to worry about the present. But the present is the most important "time" for an organization. "How is the organization doing now?" "What do people think about our app now?" "Is our party popular now?"

Data Science techniques play a vital role in explaining "the now". And the best data scientists are excellent at this.

## Concluding thoughts

Sadly, very few organizations make the best use of this triad of super-powers: Past, Future and Present. Most organizations are happy to use data scientists as a "press office". To postrationalize their (often foolish) actions.

It's time to change.
