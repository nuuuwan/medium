# He said, she said

### Frustrations on "ABC (said XYZ)".

I just read yet another post from a friend (let's call them PQR) of the form "ABC (said XYZ)" where the post had no justification for the statement ABC, but one was supposed to accept it solely on the basis that person XYZ was learned, wise, knowledgeable, "an expert", popular, or simply a "good person" — whatever that means. The 90% of the social media traffic around Sri Lankan's ongoing Constitutional gymnastics falls into this "He said, She said" category.

My first reaction to this is frustration — especially when I don't agree with ABC, but also in cases when I do agree — but feel it lacks detail or nuance or context.

>>> "Why?" [You might ask] "These people are not posting under oath? Is a post like this significantly different from the memes, selfies, kitten, puppy, baby or other infant mammal pics and videos one encounters on social medial?"

You have a point. So why do I care?

This is why:

* An increasing number of people get their news, have their discussions and form their opinions on social media.

* This processes are predominantly based on "He said, she said" type data-points.

* This misinformedness leads to all manner of social, political and economic sins.

### Enter, Advocatus diaboli

>>> "But" [you say, for you're the Devil's Advocate] "I have the following objections"

>>> OBJECTION 1: What's wrong with data points of the form "He said, she said" ?

>>> OBJECTION 2: Suppose (for a moment) that we agree that something is wrong. But no one actually agrees with us, right?

>>> OBJECTION 3: Suppose you were right. And something was wrong with "He said, she said" — and everyone also agreed with you. It's not like we can do something about it, right?

### OBJECTION 1: What's wrong with data points of the form "He said, she said" ?

The problem with person PQR posting "ABC (said XYZ)" is that the truth of the statement ABC is anchored to the authority of XYZ. The visibility of this statement (in turn) is tied to the popularity of PQR. A special case of this is when PQR and XYZ is one and the same; the words and deeds of famous people get a lot of airing on social media.

The problem with all this is that XYZ is judged on authority and popularity; not rationality. An "authoritative" or popular person's lie is truer than an unknown person's truth. And this is, in turn, problematic, because truth is repressed in favor of popular lies, from the mouths of "authorities".

>>> "But wait" [You say] "Surely, you take medicine on a doctor's authority? How is this different from going to a doctor, and getting medical advise?"

Disagree! Going to the doctor's is very different.

* Doctors have qualifications. The institutions giving these qualifications are regulated. The said doctors and institutions can be sued if they malpractice. On the other hand, many commentators on the internet have dubious qualifications. The memes and sound-bites they produce are more like candy or cocaine, than a medical prescription; they give you a quick dopamine rush, are easy to hide, and have delayed and little understood negative effects. You can't sue an internet celebrity for lying or misleading. You can't even question or contradict them — because your reply will only be seen by your 10 best friends, and none of their 10 Million fans. To summarize, the medical profession has checks and balances (literally as well as figuratively). Social media does not.

* If you have a complex disease you can and should do some research, discuss at length, and even get multiple "second opinions". Given that health is important, most people are willing to put in the extra work. On the other hand, few people (deep down) really care about quality and truth on the internet. There is little checking, and validation. In other words, people take quality in the medical profession seriously. Few people take the effects of social media seriously, until the patient is already terminally ill.

### OBJECTION 2: Suppose (for a moment) that we agree that something is wrong. But no one actually agrees with us, right?

What exactly will we be agreeing on disagreeing on? There are a few different things.

* "He said, She said" make poor data-points

* Social Media has led to political, social and economic problems.

Now, most people will agree with 2, even if they don't completely agree with 1. The statements 1 and 2 are also different in that 1 refers to a specific aspect of social media, and 2 is general; and "political, social and economic problems" is easier to observe and measure than ""He said, She said" make poor data-points".

In fact, 2 is a delayed effect of 1 (and many quirks like it). This is difficult to measure without a lot of data, but many early studies already confirm it. Like smoking, the process of realization might be slow, painful, and punctuated with controversy. But the faster it happens the less people will die.

### OBJECTION 3: Suppose you were right. And something was wrong with "He said, she said" — and everyone also agreed with you. It's not like we can do something about it, right?

Let me answer this question by a series of cause-and-effect statements.

* What is the cause of "He said, she said" posts? They are engaging, and easy to create.

* Why is "easy to create" so popular? Because people are not penalized for being lazy. A puppy photo that takes 3 seconds to upload will get 100x more likes than a painfully researched blog or article written during the course of 3 weeks.

* Why are "engaging" posts popular? Because they result in people spending a lot of time on the platform.

* Why is "spending a lot of time on the platform" so important? Because the people can be monetized in the short term, and the metric "time spent on the site" attracts investors and advertisers in the long term.

>>> "Can you please get to the point?" [You complain] "How do you get rid of "He said, she said" posts?

Well you need to get rid of the causes of "He said, she said", as follows:

* Social Media platforms should reward long-form articles over short-form memes, pics, and tweets. More on this in [2].

* Social Media platforms should have more conservative expectations on revenue from advertising (note "conservative expectations" not "zero expectations")
