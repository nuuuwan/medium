# 2 Types of Internet

### Philosophizing on technology

"What is the internet?" I ask you.

"A collection of devices connected by wires", you reply.

"And what does it do?"

"The devices can communicate information with each other", you continue. "For example, your phone and my phone are part of this network. I type in a message on WhatsApp. Moments later, it reaches your phone. My phone communicates with your phone."

"And has the internet always been like this?"

"More or less."

"Then what has changed?"

"Well", you consider, "More devices are part of the network, more types of devices, and the network itself has got faster, broader, and more reliable."

"And how will it change in the future?"

"It will get faster, broader and more reliable. And more and more devices will join the internet."

I'm silent.
