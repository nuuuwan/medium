### CoViD19 in Sri Lanka

# CoViD19 "Recovery Rates"

### A Rough Analysis

As of 4/30 (morning), Sri Lanka had 649 confirmed cases of CoViD19, of which, 136 had recovered, and 7 had died.

Do these numbers say anything about how Sri Lankan's recover from CoViD19?

More specifically, do they say anything about,

* What proportion of infected cases recover ("recovery rate")?

* How much time does recovery take?

This article is a rough attempt at a rough (and incomplete) answer to these questions.

## Data (and its Limitations)

In this analysis, I use data published at https://www.hpb.health.gov.lk. Here is a summary chart:

How do we compute the "recovery rate"?

Ideally, we consider all the patients known to be infected on or before a particular date, and track their progress, until all have either recovered or died. The "recovery rate" is the number of recoveries divided by the number of total cases.

Unfortunately, we cannot compute this.

We do know "all the patients known to be infected on or before a particular date". This is the "Confirmed" number.

However, we do not know their progress. This is because all numbers are reported relative to the current date, not confirmation date.

For example, "136 had recovered by 4/30" includes every single "known to be infected on or before a particular date" — not a particular one.

## A Naive Approximation

We could compute a "naive recovery rate" as the ratio between "Recovered" as of some date, and "Confirmed" as of that same date. This is "naive" because patients take 2–3 weeks to recover from CoViD19.

Hence, a case "Confirmed" today might not recover for several weeks. Hence, the "naive recovery rate" significantly underestimates the recovery rate.

## A Less Naive (but still incomplete) Alternative

Instead of comparing "Recovered" to "Confirmed", we could compare it to "Confirmed" from some time ago; say 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks.

Note, the "Confirmed (1 week ago)" line is the same "Confirmed" line "shifted to the right by one week. Similarly, "Confirmed (2 weeks ago) is shifted by 2 weeks, and so on.

We see that "Recovered" tends to lie somewhere between "Confirmed (3 weeks ago)" and "Confirmed (4 weeks ago)".

We can also compute and plot the ratio between "Recovered" and various shifted "Confirmed" numbers. "Recovery Rate (after x week)" is "Recovered" / "Confirmed (x week ago)".

How do we intepret these results?

It's not straight-forward. This is why I qualify the "Recovery Rate" in quotes. The problem is with the "recovery window" we consider.

* "Recovery Rate (after 1 week)" is currently about 43%. Does that mean 57% of people will die of CoViD19? Of course not. The problem with this estimate is that the "recovery window" is too small. As I mentioned, recover takes 2–3weeks; sometimes more. So, most of the 57% are likely to recover in the future.

* "Recovery Rate (after 4 weeks)" is currently about 94%. The problem with this number is that the "Recovered" number is likely to have people who were infected with the disease after the "4 weeks ago" deadline. This is why "Recovered" is greater than "Confirmed (4 weeks ago)", and "Recovery Rate (after 4 weeks0" > 100%. Hence, a large "recovery window" is likely to overestimate the "recovery rate".

Is there some other window we can use? 2 weeks? 3 weeks? 2.5 weeks?

Sadly not. "In-between" recovery windows will also have the same problems associated with small and large windows to various extents. Hence, this metric, if not as naive, is also incomplete.

## Concluding Thoughts

I mentioned, that the "right" way to compute the recovery rate was as follows:

>>> ...we consider all the patients known to be infected on or before a particular date, and track their progress, until all have either recovered or died. The "recovery rate" is the number of recoveries divided by the number of total cases.

Sadly, even this number is likely to be wrong.

Because, the patients we choose to test is a biased sample. They are not a random sample of Sri Lankans. Currently, due to a shortage of tests, we only test people who are most likely to be infected (e.g. Display symptoms, in close contact with confirmed cases etc).

Hence, the "right way" would be,

>>> ...we consider all the patients known to be infected on or before a particular date, based off a statistically significant random testing sample, and track their progress, until all have either recovered or died. The "recovery rate" is the number of recoveries divided by the number of total cases.
