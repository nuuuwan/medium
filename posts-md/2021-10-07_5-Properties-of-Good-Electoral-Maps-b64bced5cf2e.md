# 5 Properties of Good Electoral Maps

### Redrawing Sri Lanka's Electoral Map

In Proportional Representation, First-Past-the-Post or Both, we discussed three alternatives to Proportional Representation (PR) — the Electoral System currently used in Sri Lankan General Elections.

We concluded with three questions, the first of which was,

>>> "What would the Electoral Map look like if we returned to FPTP or adopted some mixed system?".

Before we answer this question, we need to answer a meta-question, namely,

>>> "What properties make a Good Electoral Map?".

In this article, we discuss five such properties.

## 1) Population Balance

(and why we can't use the existing Electoral Map)

The population of an Electoral District or Polling Division must be proportional to the seats assigned to it. We call this property "Population Balance".

For example, Since Sri Lanka has about 20.3M people*, if our new EM has 160 electorates, each must contain about 130K people.

[*All population statistics quoted in this article are from the 2012 census.]

The current EM has significant differences in Population Balance.

At one extreme, the Kayts PD has 40K people. At the other extreme, the giant Nuwara-Eliya PD has 420K. If both PDs elected one MP, Kayts would have 10x as much representation (per capita) in parliament as Nuwara-Eliya.

Similarly, some EDs have a disproportionately larger or smaller number of PDs than the assigned seats.

If we assigned 160 seats across each ED in proportion to population, Jaffna ED (697K people) would get five seats, while Colombo ED (2.32M) would get 18. However, currently, Jaffna has 11 PDs, while Colombo has only 15. Hence, if we assigned one seat to each existing PD, Jaffna would have almost 2.5x as representation (per capita) as Colombo.

In other words, if we are to use First-Past-the-Post or a Mixed Electoral System, we need a new Electoral Map.
