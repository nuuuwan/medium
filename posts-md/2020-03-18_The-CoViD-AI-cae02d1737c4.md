# The CoViD AI

### "Who to Quarantine" and Other Decisions

This article is a thought experiment about an imaginary Artificial Intelligence, which I call the "CoViD AI" (or CAI for short). This AI is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent about all things CoViD-19. I discuss what CAI would look like, and how we might build something like CAI.

[Disclaimer: The concepts described in this article are not original, and quite standard. Many have already written about it. Some are even making parts of it work.]

## The Qualities of CAI

### Omnipresent

CoViD, like many contagious diseases, is all about proximity. Person A infects Person B, only if one is physically close to the other. Hence, the first thing we need to know is was Person A close to Person B.

An Omnipresent CAI is "present everywhere" and would know where everyone is. And hence would be able to tell us where Person A or Person B is at a particular time:

```
function getLocation(person, time):    return location
```

If we know the locations of Person A and Person B at any time, we know also know the physical distance between Person A and Person B, and any particular time. And more importantly, whether they were close enough to each other to infect.

```
function getDistance(personA, personB, time):    return getDistanceBetweenLocations(        getLocationA(person, time),        getLocationB(person, time),    )
```

### Omniscient

Fighting CoViD is all about testing. We have to know if PersonA is sick with CoViD.

An Omniscient CAI is "all-knowing", and hence knows if any Person is sick.

```
function isSick(person):    return result
```

Not only would an Omniscient CAI know whether a person is sick, but it would also know what to do with this knowledge. For example, if a person is sick, they might need quarantine with different levels of medical support. A healthy 20-year-old will need very different treatment than a 70-year-old with diabetes and a weak heart.

```
function getAction(person):    result = isSick(person)    return getActionForTestResultAndPerson(result, person)
```

### Omnipotent

All the knowledge in the world is useless if one doesn't make use of it. In other words, make and take intelligent decisions and action based on that knowledge.

An Omnipotent CAI would have the "power to do anything". It would execute the action (determined omniscient) in a timely and efficient manner.

## AI without CAI

But CAI does not exist. Even the Chinese or the Americans, with all their AI prowess, have not succeeded in building one. A machine with such powers will likely never exist. So, what do we do?

We approximate. We might not have omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent powers, but we can try to get close. Here are some ideas:

### Almost Omnipresent

Most Sri Lankans carry phones, and many of these are "location intelligent" smartphones. Hence, in theory, an Omnipresent CAI who knows where everyone is location already exists.

The Telcos that run our phone networks already have access to this information. They cannot "give away" this data to health authorities for privacy reasons. But the phone-owners could opt-in to share location, and the system could anonymise the data for security.

We could have laws to require high-risk individuals (e.g. recent returners, family and friends of infected cases) to opt-in, and advertising targeting lower-risk people.

### Almost Omniscient

One bottleneck in the CoViD battle is testing, which is expensive and time-consuming. While only a medical test can conclusively answer the "isSick" question, AI could crunch other data (location, symptoms, family details, etc.), and estimate of "probability of being sick."

```
function getProbabilitySick(person):    return p
```

Health workers could use this estimate to optimize testing. For example,

```
function doAction(person):     p = getProbabilitySick(person)    if p > 0.8:        doMedicalTest()    else if p > 0.6:        isolateAndWatch()    else if p > 0.2:        recommendSelfIsolate()    else:        doNothing()
```

[Disclaimer: I'm not a health expert, and I don't know if the probabilities and actions are meaningful. But you get the picture.]

### Approximate Omnipotent

In Sri Lanka, a combination of health workers and military personnel have done an excellent job on the "action" piece. If machine CAI "provides the tools" on the "Omnipresent" and "Omniscient", the our humans have all the "potency" to "finish the job".

## Concluding Thoughts

Time is of the essence. And will all things AI, Data is critical. Most of the data the AI needs already exists. But people who own. maintain and understand the data must come together and work on building the AI systems around them.

If this happens soon and smart, AI will play a central role in minimising the damage from CoViD-19; in the world in general, and Sri Lankan in particular.

Godspeed!
