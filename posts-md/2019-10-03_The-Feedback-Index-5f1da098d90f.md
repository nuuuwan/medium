# The FeedbackÂ Index

### On how to give goodÂ feedback

The best people in the best organisations know how to get the best out of the best people. And these best people give the best people the best feedback.

In this article, I defined eight levels of feedback: From the worst feedback (Level 0) to the best feedback (Level 7).

## Level 0: NoÂ feedback

>>> I have nothing to say about Higgins.

No feedback is worse than bad feedback. Meaningless feedback is as bad as no feedback.

>>> Higgins is an excellent chap. We get along swimmingly. I look forward to working with Higgins in the future. ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜

## Level 1: Unsubstantiated opinion

>>> Higgins is a terrible coder.

Opinion is better than no feedback or meaningless feedback. Because it might hint on some area for improvement. It is still poor feedback. It lacks nuance, might be inaccurate, is likely to be misinterpreted, and might be seen as unfair.

## Level 2: Poorly substantiated opinion. Usually with correlated (but not causal)Â facts

>>> Higgins is a terrible coder. He is always causing the system to crash.

It is unclear why the system crashed, and if Higgins was indeed the cause.

## Level 3:Â Facts

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code.*

>>> [* See tasks 13234, 13543, 13544 and 14001 for details.]

Now there is a clear causal connection between Higgins and the feedback.

## Level 4: Quantified facts

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code. As a result, we lost $1 million in sales.*

A lot of feedback, while accurate, is not relevant to things the organisation cares about. Quantifying impact aligns the feedback with the organisation's bottom line.

## Level 5: Quantified Facts with recommendations for improvement

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code. As a result, we lost $1 million in sales.

>>> Higgins could avoid such incidents by writing better unit and integration tests, and by testing his code more thoroughly.

The goal of giving feedback is not to give feedback. The goal is to improve the individual individual and the collective organisation. Constructive recommendations enable this.

## Level 6: Quantified Facts with recommendations for improvement, supported by ownership

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code. As a result, we lost $1 million in sales.

>>> Higgins could avoid such incidents by writing better unit and integration tests, and by testing his code more thoroughly.

>>> I will work with Higgins to help him improve the quality of his code. I will also monitor the resulting stability of our system.

The best people own the problem. They not only give constructive feedback but volunteer to be responsible for the solution. For these people, nothing is someone else's problem.
