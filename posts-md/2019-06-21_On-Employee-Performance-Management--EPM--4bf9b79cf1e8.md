# On Employee Performance Management (EPM)

### A Short Playbook

## Why EPM?

Everything a business does is focussed on maximizing its long-term value (LTV). "Maximizing LTV through managing the performance of employees" is an important subset of this focus. Also, compared to mature companies that have built significant customer brand, this subset is disproportionately important to start-ups, as employees (particularly founder employees) play a disproportionately important role in its direction and success or failure.

## Why "Sophisticated" EPM?

Very often, companies make the mistake of over-depending on monetary compensation for motivating employees and "keeping them happy", when there are many levers that can and should be used simultaneously. These various "levers" could be framed in terms of "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" as follows:

* Physiological/Safety. Salaries, Benefits

* Love/belonging. Treatment from colleagues, particularly superiors

* Esteem. Acknowledgement and Recognition

* Self-Actualization. Personal Growth

"Sophisticated" Employee Performance Management would use all these levers, not just the first.

## Characteristics of Good EPM

* Alignment with LTV. As described above, EPM is primarily a tool for optimizing LTV. Hence, all carrots and sticks associated with EPM should be aligned with LTV. How to weight the short, medium and long-term is an open question — but too often organizations overly optimize for the short-term.

* Fairness. A good way of differentiating a company with a good EPM and a bad EPM is to ask an employee why they think another employee gets paid more, and particularly if the latter deserves it. In other words, EPM must be seen to be fair.

* Simplicity. A business can't afford to let complicated EPM (and other "support" processes) distract from its core operations. Also, a system that is difficult to understand is rarely seen as fair. Finally, since EPM is both art and science, simplicity is one way of avoiding false precision.

## The Process

A good EPM system will have the "Good Characteristics" and also use all the "Levers of Sophistication".

* Best guess "LTV picture". EPM starts with a best-guess-timate of the companies LTV, and how various projects will contribute to this. The picture will consist of well-defined tasks, looser projects, problems with no specified solutions, known problems currently "unsolvable" and unknown problems.

* Assignment of work to people. To do EPM well, there must be a clear assignment of problems to people. Everyone must know what is expected of them. They should see both their work as yielding meaningful LTV, and as an opportunity for them to grow personally (i.e. Self-Actualize). Note, this assignment process can happen in a distributed manner. For example, a large project can be assigned to a tech-lead or engineering manager, who in terms divides the work further.

* Progress Measurement and Feedback. Often, and lightweight. Performance reviews (both formal and informal) are good opportunities for real-time acknowledgement and recognition (i.e. Esteem).

* Rewarding performance. Bonuses and Promotions. Promotion levels and performance ratings, unambiguously tied to salary bands, and are a useful tool for making bonuses and promotions simple to understand.
