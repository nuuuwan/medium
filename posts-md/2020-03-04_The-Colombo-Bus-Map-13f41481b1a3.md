# The Colombo Bus Map

### On Inaccurate Maps

## "Accurate" Maps

A map is a collection of places. Where a place appears depends on the map. Dehiwala is at the south-west of Colombo. So, on a map of Colombo Dehiwala would appear on the bottom-left corner. If the map is accurate geographically. That is, if the x-y coordinates of places match their longitudes and latitudes. As I said, it depends.

For example, here is a map of Colombo's bus routes. The bus stops are in their geographically correct place:

But what if you want to draw a different sort of map? What if, say, you don't care about geographical accuracy.

## "Inaccurate" Maps

The previous map might be geographically accurate. But it is also difficult to read. And ugly. The reader doesn't care about geographical accuracy. All they want is to get from A to B. And what routes enable this.

On such a map, places don't match their longitudes and latitudes. Instead, we try to make the bus routes look as simple as possible. If, say, a route heads roughly north to south, a straight line, top to bottom, should represent the route.

On such a map, each location is a member of one or more bus routes. Places with no bus routes we can completely ignore. Each bus route has a shape. And where a location lands depends on where on that shape it appears.

How do we determine the "shape" of a bus route? Here's the paradox. The shape starts with the "real" locations of the places. This gives a rough shape. Once we have the rough shapes of all the routes, we simplify the shapes. As much as we can.

If we redraw* our Colombo Bus Map respecting the "shapes" of the bus routes, we get the following map:

[* There are several different algorithms for doing this. There is no algorithm which is perfect in every situation. Beauty is highly subjective.]

I've updated these maps based off feedback on Twitter and Facebook. Here's a rough update history:
