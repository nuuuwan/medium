# The Great Game

### On Coins, Red Tiles and Beautiful Friends

I toss a coin and try to guess the outcome. It is a game of my own invention: with no other players and no reward, except for the possible pain of losing or the pleasure of winning.

I call "heads" and toss the coin. The coin does, indeed, land "heads".

I feel a small gush of pleasure. Satisfaction. A feeling that I am in some name or form, "better". Conversely, if luck didn't favour me, and the coin landed "tails", I would feel some small, be it ever-so-small, pain. Dissatisfaction. The feeling that I am worse-off.
