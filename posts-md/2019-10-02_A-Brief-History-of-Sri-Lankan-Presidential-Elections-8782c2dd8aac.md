# A Brief History of Sri Lankan Presidential Elections

### From 1982 to the present

The 2019 presidential election is scheduled for Saturday the 16th of November. Hence, I thought it an excellent time to reflect on the seven previous elections.

## Before 1982

The office of President was created in 1972 within Sri Lanka's first republican constitution. The then Governer-General of Ceylon, William Gopallawa became the first president of Sri Lanka. While the President replaced the British sovereign as head of state, the prime minister was still head of government.

In 1977, following a landslide victory in the parliamentary election, the UNP won 140 of 168 seats in parliament. With the second amendment to the constitution that followed in 1978, Sri Lanka moved to an executive presidential system of government where the President was both head of state, and head of government. The amendment also made the incumbent prime minister, J.R. Jayawardena, President. Hence, our first executive president took the post without a Presidential Election.

## 1982 — The First Ever

Sri Lanka's first ever presidential election was held on the 20th of October 1982.

UNP candidate and incumbent President Jayawardena won with 52.91% of the vote, winning 137 of the 160 polling divisions, similar to the 1977 parliamentary election landslide. Former Minister for Agriculture and Lands Hector Kobbekaduwa, the SLFP candidate, won 39.07%, winning 15 electoral divisions. Some caricatured the election as a capitalism vs. socialism fight, with President Jayawardena's open market reforms, following the socialist policies of the 1970–1977 SLFP government.

Marxist and revolutionary Rohana Wijeweera of the JVP won 4.19%. Kumar Ponnambalam of the ACTC won 2.67%, winning eight polling divisions mostly in Jaffna.

## 1988 — Amid Chaos

The 1988 Presidential Election was held amid two bloody conflicts: One with the LTTE in the north and east. The other with the JVP in many other parts of the country. As a result of President Jayawardena's Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Indian peace-keeping forces had also entered the country. Unsurprisingly, turnout was only 55.32%, down from 81.06% in 1982. Voting was not held in LTTE controlled parts of the country.

The incumbent prime minister and UNP candidate Ranasinghe Premadasa won the presidency with 50.43% of the vote. Former prime minister and SLFP candidate Sirimavo Bandaranaike won 44.95%.

Oswin Abeygunasekara of the SLPP won 4.63%. He also won four polling divisions. This was the last instance where a "third candidate" won any polling divisions.

## 1994 — Change, please

On May Day 1993, President Premadasa was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber at the UNPs May Day rally. Prime Minister D. B. Wijetunga was sworn in six days later as acting President.

The following year, President Wijetunga chose not to run in the Presidential Election, and, hence, the UNPs selected Gamini Dissanayake as their presidential candidate. However, on the 24th of October, just 16 days before the election, Dissanayake was himself assassinated by the LTTE, at a campaign meeting. Probably hoping to capitalize on a sympathy vote, the UNP chose Dissanayake's widow Srima as the replacement candidate, overlooking former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

In the meantime, in August 1994, the incumbent UNP had lost the parliamentary election, after holding the legislature for 17 years since 1977. The new prime minister was Chandrika Kumaratunga, leader of the SLFP, and daughter of former Prime Ministers S.W.R.D. and Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was the SLFP's obvious presidential candidate.

Kumaratunga won 62.28% of the vote, to Srima Dissanayake's 35.91%, winning all but the Mahiyanganaya polling division. This is the closest a presidential candidate has come to winning all 160 polling divisions.

## 1999 — Early polls

Given the six-year presidential term, elections were not due until 2000. However, President Kumaratunga called for early elections in 1999. The candidate from the opposition UNP was former prime minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.

After surviving an assassination attempt by the LTTE three days before the election, where she lost the use of an eye, Kumaratunga won a second term with 51.12% of the vote. Wickramasinghe won 42.71%, while Nandana Gunathilake of the JVP won 4.08%.

## 2005 — The nail-biter

Earlier in the year, President Kumaratunga filed a lawsuit arguing that, since the 1999 presidential election happened an year earlier, an extra year should be added to her second six-year term, postponing the next presidential election to 2006. However, the supreme court rejected this claim, and elections were scheduled for the 17th of November 2005.

Having served two terms, President Kumaratunga could not contest another presidential election. Instead, then prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was the front-running candidate of the ruling SLFP., while former prime minister Ranil Wickramasinghe was the UNP. candidate yet again.

The 2005 presidential election was the closest in Sri Lankan history. Rajapakse won 50.29% of the vote, just 180,786 votes more than Wickramasinghe's 48.43%.

## 2010 — The peace dividend

After the Civil War ended in May 2009, President Rajapaksa decided to end his first six-year term nearly two years early, and seek a fresh and broader mandate in a second term. A presidential election was announced for the 26th of January 2010.

General Sarath Fonseka was the opposing candidate, supported by both the UNP and the JVP. Considered a national hero of the Civil War, and commander of the Sri Lank Army from 2005 to 2009, Fonseka had fallen out with Rajapaksa after the end of the conflict.

President Rajapaksa won a second term with 57.88% of the vote, to Fonseka's 40.15%. Rajapaksa won 125 of the 160 polling divisions. Fonseka won just 35; 21 of which were in the Northern and Eastern provinces.

## 2015 — The surprise

In April 2010, President Rajapaksa's UPFA alliance won 144 of the 225 seats in the parliamentary election. That September, parliament passed the eighteenth amendment to the constitution, removing the two-term limit on presidents, allowing Rajapaksa to run for a third term.

On the 20th of November 2014, President Rajapaksa sought a presidential election. To the surprise of many, the day after, Maithripala Sirisena, Minister of Health in the Rajapakse cabinet, and general secretary of Rajapakse's own SLFP was revealed as a common opposition presidential candidate, with the support of the UNP, several UPFA members, and President Kumaratunga.

Elections were scheduled for the 8th of January, 2015.

Sirisena won 51.28% of the vote, to Rajapaksa's 47.58%.

## Common Themes

### Safe Seats

Eight polling divisions have voted for the SLFP, PA or UPFA in all seven presidential elections. They are Baddegama, Habaraduwa, Hakmana, Kamburupitiya, Kesbewa, Attanagalla, Dompe, Gampaha. No polling division has voted for the UNP in all seven presidential elections, though several have in six.

[For simplicity, I've grouped the SLFP, PA and UPFA as "Blue" and the UNP and NDF as "Green".]

### Recent Safe Seats

If we restrict our analysis to the last four elections (1999–2015), there are many more polling divisions where a single party has won all four elections.

### Voting Zones

The "safe seat" maps indicate some patterns in voting:

* There is a rural "heartland" that consistently votes Blue. This includes the Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, the inland of Puttalam, Gampaha and Colombo, Kalutara, the Southern province, the Sabaragamuwa Province, Monaragala, and the inland of Digamadulla (Ampara) and Trincomalee districts.

* The coastal parts of Colombo, Gampaha and Puttalam vote Green

* Much of the central hills usually vote Green

* The north and the east vote Green

## Concluding Warning

A sample of seven is statistically insignificant. It is dangerous to extrapolate predictions based our relatively short presidential electoral history. This warning particularly applies the forthcoming election in November.

Proceed with care. Happy voting!
