# On Dogmatists

### And how to detect them

A dogmatist is someone "inclined to lay down principles as undeniably true". These days, one meets many types of dogmatists. Religious dogmatists, Political dogmatists, even Scientific dogmatists.

## On Disagreeing

Dogmatists are very bad at one thing: disagreeing.

There is a problem with laying down "undeniably true principles". Many of end-up being false. And when you go around telling things that are false, people disagree with you. And when you have to disagree with these people, you end-up disagreeing badly. Because disagreeing badly is the only way to disagree with the truth.

## How to disagree badly

In his excellent article on How to Disagree, Paul Graham describes seven levels of disagreement, ranging from bad and crude, to good and enlightened.

Here are some summary quotes:

### DH0. Name-calling

>>> This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most common. We've all seen comments like this:

>>> "u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!"

### DH1. Ad Hominem (Latin "to man").

>>> An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It might actually carry some weight. For example, if a senator wrote an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could respond:

>>> "Of course he would say that. He's a senator."

>>> This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be relevant to the case. It's still a very weak form of disagreement, though. If there's something wrong with the senator's argument, you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does it make that he's a senator?

### DH2. Responding to Tone

>>> The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather than the writer. The lowest form of these is to disagree with the author's tone. E.g.

>>> "I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion."

### DH3. Contradiction

>>> In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom. The lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting evidence.

>>> This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:

>>> "I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory"

### DH4. Counterargument

>>> At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement: counterargument. Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing. Counterargument might prove something. The problem is, it's hard to say exactly what.

### DH5. Refutation

>>> The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It's also the rarest, because it's the most work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you go the fewer instances you find.

>>> To refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to find a "smoking gun," a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken. If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man.

### DH6. Refuting the Central Point

>>> The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.

>>> Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them. And that means one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is. So a truly effective refutation would look like:

>>> "The author's main point seems to be x. As he says:<quotation> But this is wrong for the following reasons..."

## Detecting a Dogmatist

Hence, if someone says something that sounds dogmatic, and you point out the falseness of their "undeniably true principles", if they disagree well with your point, there's a good chance that the "undeniably true principles" are actually true, and you were wrong. On the other hand, if they disagree badly, then there's a good chance that they are a dogmatist.
