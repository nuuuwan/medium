RE: Also, in the proposal to recalibrate it, would the recalibration happen prior to every election?

I believe it is calibrated before each election.

RE: And should there be other factors other than number of voters? e.g. perhaps poorer districts should have more representation?

Other factors do influence it. That mostly explains the disproportions. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_districts_of_Sri_Lanka for details.
