# Where exactly is the "location"?

### Do we need an alternative address scheme for Sri Lanka?

## "I've come to the location" ("මම location එකට ආවා").

The following episode happens to me all the time; I'm sure it's also happened to you.

>>> I call an Uber. The Uber App notifies me that the driver is very close.

>>> Then the driver calls me and says: "I've come to the location" ("මම location එකට ආවා").

>>> I go to your meeting point, but the car is nowhere to be seen.

>>> I call the driver again, and ask him where he is.

>>> He replies: "I'm at the location" ("මම location එකේ").

Uber, other taxi/ride-sharing apps, as well as countless other applications from navigation to e-commerce, rely on GPS. In theory, GPS should be precise enough for Uber drivers and riders to meet at a same-enough location. Unfortunately, in practice, due to a combination of low-quality smartphones, expensive or poor internet connectivity, and obstructions like tall buildings, GPS is often not accurate enough for a comfortable app experience.

Hence, the humans in the loop have to make do with various offline information to make up for GPS's short-comings.

>>> Me: Where are you?

>>> Driver: I'm in front of Dialog office.

>>> Me: I'm on the other side of the road. In front of the big Mobitel Billboard, next to the PickMe CEO's house.

## The problem

GPS and the associate map and location data system, collectively answer two questions:

GPS answers the question:

* Question 1: "What is the latitude and longitude?"

Next, the map and location data system answers the question:

* Question 2: "What does this latitude and longitude mean in human language? I.e. Relative to addresses, landmarks, and buildings

In practice, the answer to Question 1, is not completely accurate. If it is more than (say) 10m off the mark, the humans have to answer another question:

* Question 3: "I need to get to get from this set of addresses, landmarks, or buildings to this other set of addresses, landmarks, or buildings, which, hopefully are not far away. How do I do that?"

For most parts of Sri Lanka, Question 2 is not a problem. Most apps have generally accurate maps and location information.

The Question 1 problem, is a technology problem. In the long term, as GPS, phones and network bandwidth improve, this problem should gradually go away. However, what do we do in the short term?

The obvious solution is to make it easier to answer Question 3.

## The problem with Question 3

If you were in Manhattan, where most of the roads are organized in streets and avenues, you can easily figure out how to get from the Museum of Art and Design (Corner of 8th avenue, and 58th street), to Carnegie Hall (7th and 57th).

But in Colombo or London, where most of the roads have grown and named "organically", you might have to resort to "Dialog buildings" and "Mobitel billboards". We also don't have consistent house or building numbering. For example, it is normal to have No. 14 following No. 20, with 22A, 22/5 and 22B/23 following that. Roads also have multiple equivalent names.

## Conclusion

The way around this problem might be to re-address all locations in Sri Lanka under some new scheme.

What do you, the reader, think? Should we invent something new?
