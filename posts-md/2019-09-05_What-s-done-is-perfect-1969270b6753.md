# What's done is perfect

### Confessions of a three handed house-sweeper

Sweeping a house is a bitter-sweet experience.

On one hand, the good thing about giving your house a jolly-good sweep with a broom is that you end-up with a cleaner house.

On the other hand, there are a couple of things I find frustrating:

* During sweeping, the back and forth movement of the broom causes a mini "wind-surge" that disturbs the already swept heap of dirt.

* After sweeping, the process of transferring the dirt from the floor, to the dust-pan and finally to the dust-bin is never perfect. There's always a bit left on the floor.

But on the third hand, these frustrations do have a silver lining. Whenever the wind-serge distrubs the heap, usually only a small amount of dirt is disturbed. So you still have more dirt in the heap than pre-sweeping. Similarly, with each episode of the dust-pan, there is less dirt on the floor.

This reminds me of Achilles and the Tortoise, and the geomatric series. Consider:

>>> 1 + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + ...

This series never sums to 2 exactly. But with each addition, it gets closer and closer to two. After 2 steps, it is equal to 1.5. After 4 steps, 1.875. After 10 steps, ~1.999.... After 20 steps, ~1.99999...

Sweeping is like this geometric series. After each sweep of the broom, the floor is a little cleaner, and a little closer to the perfect floor. As is the case after each scoop of the dust-pan. A theorotical perfection is never reached, but each step is more and more perfect. A sort of absolute (if not relative) perfection.

In fact, 1.5, 1.875, 1.999... and 1.999999... all have their own perfection. They might not be exactly 2, but they are computed and done. And what's done is perfect.

But I'll stop writing now. What's done is perfect.
