# On Sinhala Pronunciation

### And how I've been mispronouncing my name all my life

### English sucks, Sinhala is beautiful

The English alphabet is a mess. The letters seem to be in no particular order, there are no patterns, and the only way to learn it is to memorize it (all 26 letters) from A to Z.

English pronunciation is even worse. While most languages have some deterministic relationship between letters and sounds of words, in English "bough", "cough", and "dough" have completely different endings. Hence, again, the only way to learn spelling is to memorize.

The Sinhala Alphabet is phonetic and far better organized. It first lists all the vowels, followed by the consonants, both of which are in order of pronunciation.

Consonants are ordered based on the location of sound production, starting with the soft palette on the roof of the mouth (e.g. ක, "ka" as in "kill"), through the hard palate (ච, "ca" as in "chill"), the alveolar ridge (ට, "ṭa" as in "till"), the teeth (ත, "ta" as in "thick"), before finally ending with the lips (ප, "pa" as in "pill")

### To Err is to mispronounce

Given that Sinhala is phonetic, you might think that spelling is easy. But there are a few exceptions that arise from speakers (like myself) not knowing how to pronounce certain characters correctly.

The "na" (as in noon) sound is a good example. There are two "na" sounds in Sinhala:

* ණ — sounded from the alveolar ridge, like ට ("till")

* න — sounded from the teeth, like ත ("thick")

Many people (like myself) use the ණ (alveolar ridge, like "till") pronunciation for the "na" sound, even when spelling intends න (teeth, like "thick").

Another standard error is to mix the two "la" sounds: ල and ළ.

### A name by any other pronunciation would mean as meaningful?

My name spelt "Nuwan" in English, corresponds to two different words, with different spelling, meanings and pronunciation in Sinhala: "නුවන්" and "නුවණ්". The former (which is my name) means "eyes"; the latter means "wisdom".

Throughout my life, I have been pronouncing my name as "ණුවණ්", which is neither of the above, has no meaning in Sinhala, and never occurs within the many petabytes that make up the internet.

Time for a change?
