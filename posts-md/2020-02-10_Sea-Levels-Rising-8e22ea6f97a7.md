# Sea Levels Rising

### What if Sea Levels rise by 1m?

>>> 

Recently I posted a video simulating what Sri Lanka would look like if sea levels rose by 100m. While many found the video interesting, even entertaining, I did caveat the tweet with:

>>> To be clear, this is an unlikely scenario. Estimates indicate a few meters in the next century. But even 1m would submerge many densely populated parts of the country, incl. much of #Colombo and #Jaffna.

A rise of 100m is almost impossible. Possibly for several centuries. Probably until after the next ice age. On the other hand, 1m is entirely possible. Certainly in a century. Possibly in decades.

What if Sea Levels rise by 1m? What would be the impact on Sri Lanka? How many people would be affected?

## Methodology

In this article, I attempt an approximate answer to these questions. "Approximate" because my population information (2012 census) was at the Grama Niladaari Division (GND) level. I assume that the altitude (above sea level) for the entire population in the GND is the mean altitude of the GND.

Since this analysis mostly considers small altitudes (e.g. less than 1m), this approximation is reasonable. For example, if the mean altitude of the GND is below 1m, most of the population is likely to live below 1m.

### Sri Lanka (621,432 people at risk, 3% of population)

About 621,432 Sri Lankans or 3% of the population live below 1m. While the GNDs at risk cover a relatively small area, these are usually densely populated.

### Colombo (100,607, 4%)

The largest number of people at risk by district live in the Colombo District. Mostly concentrated around Colombo North, Colombo Central, and the Moratuwa area.

### Batticaloa (84417, 16%), Ampara (77540, 12%), and Trincomalee (62290, 16%)

After Colombo, the most populous at-risk districts are Batticaloa, Ampara and Trincomalee. With about 16% of their populations at risk, Batticaloa and Trincomalee have the highest proportions of the population at risk.

## Caveats

As noted in the Methodology, these computations are approximate. Also, we consider only altitude as a fact. Other factors, like severe floods and rising rivers and lakes, could even submerge significant parts of the island.
