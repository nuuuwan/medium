# Aphorisms on the State

### And Democracy, Education, Development, Equity and Identity

## The State

* A state is a collection of individuals known as citizens.

* Every individual has needs

* Some individuals have the ability to satisfy needs. We call this ability power.

* Citizens act to satisfy some subset of their needs. Which subset varies from situations to situation. And might be unpredictable and irrational.

* Control is the ability of one individual to influence the actions of another individual. Citizens with needs are controlled by the citizens who have power to satisfy those needs.

* The law is a collection of conditions. That specify if something happens, then something else must happen. Whether it will happen depends how the citizens decide to act.

* Different states differ in how laws are defined, executed and judged. This system of defining, executing and judging laws is known as a "system of government".

* A Democracy is a system of government where all citizens have an equal opportunity to act in defining, executing and judging laws.

* Since citizens act to satisfy their needs, these actions in defining, executing and judging laws are controlled by citizens with power. Hence, in a democracy defining, executing and judging are influenced by citizens with power.

## Education

* A Perfect Democracy is a system of government where all citizens have an equal influence to act in defining, executing and judging laws.

* An educated citizen is one with the ability to influence productive outcomes.

* Hence, a perfect democracy with educated citizens achieves productive outcomes. One without educated citizens does not achieve productive results.

## Equity

* Equity is the equalise of a state's citizens' power.

* In an equal state, equal opportunity to act in defining, executing and judging laws converges with equal influence in defining, executing and judging laws. Democracy and Perfect Democracy converge.

* In an unequal state, influence concentrates in the hands of a few. Such a state is known as an oligarchy.

* Hence, Democracy can coexist with both Oligarchy and Perfect Democracy. Depending on the nature of equity.

## Development

* Development is a measure of the sophistication of a state's citizens' needs. A more developed state has citizens with more sophisticated needs.

* Sophistication is a measure of the intrinsic nature of needs. Needs that must be satisfied externally (extrinsically, hence less intrinsically) are less sophisticated. Needs that must be satisfied intrinsically, are more sophisticated.

* Hence, citizens whose needs are more sophisticated are less vulnerable to control from other citizens.

* Hence, a developed state is more likely to tend towards a perfect democracy, as opposed to an oligarchy.

## Identity

* State Identity is a citizen's need to align their needs with the needs of other citizens. A state with strong state identity has citizens with shared needs.

* State Identity tends to have "medium" sophistication. It relies on some extrinsic "feedback signals", but also intrinsic beliefs.

* The need to act in defining, executing and judging laws of the state (i.e. "participate"), is an example of state identity.

* Hence, states with strong state identities are more likely to tend towards a perfect democracy, as opposed to an oligarchy.
