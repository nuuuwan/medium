### The sense of nothing and everything

I found myself in,

By a series of by chance,

Events and therein,

(Accidents of circumstance),

Of Adi-Vel. And sights within.

...

Sounds were a carpet,

Not one sound, but many sounds

Drum and trumpet,

A spectrum of tone compounds,

Melodies shone on garnet.

...

And as the sounds like

Red, Green, Orange, Yellow, Blue,

A palette of psych,

A universal mind hue,

Varied and dreamlike.

...

And incense and oil,

Gingerly and coconut

Pantheon of voile,

Ripening fruits. Fresh and cut

An offering of turmoil.

...

Why so different?

From a Chopinesque nocturne,

Escoffier scent,

Or a Monet water fern?

Why so completely diff'rent?

...

And so I thought shear,

Only to then realise,

The diff'rence was clear

For one made me think sidewise,

For one Thought would disappear.

...

Motif in Chopin,

Or a star in a Monet

Just as an omen,

The taste of a hidden spray,

In each one, thought would home in.

...

Narrowing to nought.

But the other had no thought,

An expansion fought,

Mind and universe unsought,

The eternal realm unthought.

# On Company Culture

### How culture should be a meta-culture

Many people have asked me questions about company culture (i.e. the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a company): what a good company culture is, how a good company culture can be built and maintained, and why some companies have good cultures and others have bad ones.

When I left Facebook in 2017, I wrote a parting note to my collegues and the company, listing the most valuable things I had learnt working at Facebook. One of these valuable things was company culture.

Hence, I thought I'd share part of that parting note with a wider audience.

## "A Meta-Culture that earns its keep"

>>> Acquaintances working at other companies often question me about Facebook's "company culture", particular on how good it is, and why. My answer to (my view on) "The secret to Facebook's culture" sometimes confuses, even disappoints.

>>> What we have is a "meta-culture". Our culture is not constant, nor sacrosanct. Our culture at any given point of time, is whatever culture that will help us achieve our long-term mission in the most efficient way — obviously, subject to basic human decency and sense. A culture that served a 500-employee company well, might not be ideal for a 5,000-employee company. Hence, a successful culture constantly evolves with the successful organization it helps create.

>>> Like the teams, projects and products that help us achieve our mission, our culture must earn its keep. If a project is failing, we kill it, and move onto something better. The same applies to culture, and I'm proud of the times we've acknowledged that something in our culture was not right, renewed ourselves, and moved on — a stronger and better company.

>>> [From 2017]

## Meta-Culture Dos and Don'ts

Given that I believe that a good culture is not constant, nor sacrosanct, I can't recommend or pontificate on what a good culture is or what a bad culture is. A good culture is company and time dependent. No one culture fits all.

However, I'd like to embellish my 2017 write-up with some additional principles that might be useful.

* Do hire good people. Culture is very much a function of people. Hire good people, and you'll (more or less) have a good culture.

* Do work on culture. Culture needs work. Problems rarely fix themselves, and usually get worse if not solved. Bad culture is a bad problem; if it is ignored or condoned, it will get worse.

* Do have good incentives. Culture adapts to stimuli. If the company has a bad cultural practice, but there is no disincentive to discourage this, that practice will go on. Good incentives encourage good culture. Bad incentives encourage bad culture.

* Don't worship cultural precepts too much. If they are sacrosanct, getting rid of them becomes blasphemous. As your company evolves, some once suitable precepts will become unsuitable. You can't get rid of something unsuitable, if it is also sacrosanct.

* Don't make culture an end. "Having some culture X" is never the mission of a company. It is merely a means that will help achieve that mission efficiently. Don't sacrifice your mission chasing after some particular culture.

# Do you know where you live?

### A guide to describing locations in Sri Lanka

## Addresses, Provinces and Districts

The president of Sri Lanka lives at, 01 Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01

[For those who don't read Sinhala, "Janadhipathi Mawatha" means "President Avenue"].

"Colombo 01" denotes the "Colombo Fort" neighbourhood of Colombo, and is part of the Colombo District, which is, itself, part of the Western Province, one of Sri Lanka's 9 provinces.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*15grBoaAp2YEmsOyi8i4lw.png)

But there are other ways of describing where the president lives.

## Post Codes

"Colombo 01" can be alternatively referred to by the post code "00100". These five-digit post codes were first introduced in 1997.

[I couldn't find an official list of Sri Lankan Post Codes. The most comprehensive list had 64 unique post codes in the Colombo District.]

Hence, the president lives in the 00100 post code area.

## Local Government Divisions

After the central government, and provincial governments, local governments are the third and lowest level of government in Sri Lanka, and were introduced in the 13th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka in 1987.

Local government is divided into three different groups:

* Municipal Councils (මහ නගර සභා)

* Urban Councils (නගර සභා)

* Divisional Councils (ප්‍රාදේශීය සභා).

The Western province consists of 49 local government divisions, of which 13 are in the Colombo District. Of these 13, Five are Municipal Councils (Colombo, Dehiwala Mount-Lavinia, Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte, Kaduwela, Moratuwa), five are Urban Councils (Kolonnawa, Seethawakapura, Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Kesbewa), and three are Divisional Councils Kolonnawa(Homagama, Kotikawatta Mulleriyawa, Seethawaka).

The president's house is located in the Colombo Municipal Council's governance area.

## Administrative Divisions

Districts in Sri Lanka are also divided into administrative divisions known as Divisional Secretariat Divisions, or DSDs. Some of these administrative divisions date back to feudal counties, the korales and ratas of the Sinhala kings. Sri Lanka has 331 DSDs, of which 13 are in the Colombo District.

DSDs are further divided into Grama Niladaari Divisions (GNDs). The 13 DSDs in the Colombo District are divided into 566 Grama Niladaari Divisions.

The president's house is in the Fort GND, which is part of the Colombo DSD, which itself is part of the Colombo District.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mU4Ug0btWrd4bVHB0luf5w.png)

## Electoral Divisions

While Sri Lanka has 25 administrative districts, it has 22 electoral districts, following the 1978 Constitution. The 22 electoral districts mirror the 25 administrative district exactly, except in the case of the Jaffna electoral district (which consists of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi administrative districts), and the Vanni electoral district (which consists of the Mannar, Mulativu, and Vavuniya administrative districts).

The Colombo administrative districts is the same as the Colombo electoral districts. And hence, the president's house is also located in the Colombo electoral district.

Each electoral district is divided into polling divisions. Sri lanka's 22 electoral districts have a total of 160 polling divisions. The Colombo electoral district consists of 15 polling divisions, of which the president's house is located in the Colombo Central polling division.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PUYEa00yd4bZzQgcH-yY2g.jpeg)

## Bonus Division: Phone Codes

The Presidential Secretariat's phone number is 011 2354354, which begins with a 011 Colombo phone code.

Sri Lanka has 29 regional phone codes, which roughly correspond to districts. Some districts have more than one phone code. For example, Gampaha district has two phone codes: 033 for Gampaha and 031 for Negombo. The 036 phone code for Avissawella spans both the Colombo and Kegalle Districts, and hence both the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces.

## Summary

Given all the different ways of describing where the president lives, we have:

* Address: 01 Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01

* District: Colombo District

* Province: Western Province

* Country: Sri Lanka

* Post Code Area: 00100

* Local Government: Colombo Municipal Council

* Divisional Secretariat Division: Colombo DSD

* Grama Niladhari Division: Fort GND

* Electoral District: Colombo Electoral District

* Polling Division: Colombo Central Polling Division

* Phone Code Area: 011

## Disclaimer

This article is based on several data sources, which might be out of date. Please comment if you notice any discrepencies.

I'm also looking for more detailed data that will answer questions like,

* Does a Grama Niladhari Division span multiple Local Government Divisions?

* What is the relationship between post codes and administrative divisions?

* What is the relationship between local government divisions, administrative divisions, and polling divisions?

Stay tuned for updates!

# On Dogmatists

### And how to detect them

A dogmatist is someone "inclined to lay down principles as undeniably true". These days, one meets many types of dogmatists. Religious dogmatists, Political dogmatists, even Scientific dogmatists.

## On Disagreeing

Dogmatists are very bad at one thing: disagreeing.

There is a problem with laying down "undeniably true principles". Many of end-up being false. And when you go around telling things that are false, people disagree with you. And when you have to disagree with these people, you end-up disagreeing badly. Because disagreeing badly is the only way to disagree with the truth.

## How to disagree badly

In his excellent article on How to Disagree, Paul Graham describes seven levels of disagreement, ranging from bad and crude, to good and enlightened.

Here are some summary quotes:

### DH0. Name-calling

>>> This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most common. We've all seen comments like this:

>>> "u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!"

### DH1. Ad Hominem (Latin "to man").

>>> An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It might actually carry some weight. For example, if a senator wrote an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could respond:

>>> "Of course he would say that. He's a senator."

>>> This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be relevant to the case. It's still a very weak form of disagreement, though. If there's something wrong with the senator's argument, you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does it make that he's a senator?

### DH2. Responding to Tone

>>> The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather than the writer. The lowest form of these is to disagree with the author's tone. E.g.

>>> "I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion."

### DH3. Contradiction

>>> In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom. The lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting evidence.

>>> This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:

>>> "I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory"

### DH4. Counterargument

>>> At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement: counterargument. Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing. Counterargument might prove something. The problem is, it's hard to say exactly what.

### DH5. Refutation

>>> The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It's also the rarest, because it's the most work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you go the fewer instances you find.

>>> To refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to find a "smoking gun," a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken. If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man.

### DH6. Refuting the Central Point

>>> The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.

>>> Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them. And that means one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is. So a truly effective refutation would look like:

>>> "The author's main point seems to be x. As he says:<quotation> But this is wrong for the following reasons..."

## Detecting a Dogmatist

Hence, if someone says something that sounds dogmatic, and you point out the falseness of their "undeniably true principles", if they disagree well with your point, there's a good chance that the "undeniably true principles" are actually true, and you were wrong. On the other hand, if they disagree badly, then there's a good chance that they are a dogmatist.

You can use Paul Grahams "How to Disagree" index as a measure of your confidence:

# The Three Pillars of AI

### Can an organization succeed at AI?

AI is the buzzword of all buzzwords these days. Everyone wants to do AI. Students want to study AI at school and university. Tech Startups wish to build the next "big AI idea". Organizations want to be "AI-first". Countries wish to define AI policies and manifestos.

All these parties should be asking one question: Can we succeed at AI?

In this article, I focus on one of these parties: Organizations. I want to answer the question: "Can an organization succeed at AI?"

## 1. Technology

The first pillar of AI is technology.

When people talk about AI, they (usually) talk about Technology: AI hardware or AI software. Some of the biggest recent leaps in AI have come from advances in hardware. Chips are capable of the extraordinary processing power that AI algorithms need. The internet of things logs vast amounts of data which AI systems can crunch. High bandwidth networks, shuttle data to and from, at high speed and low cost. Advances in software have piggy-backed on this hardware. The theory and algorithms behind deep-learning (for example) are decades old. But it is the recent hardware advances that have made these practical and useful.

Most AI algorithms are part of open source projects. Scientific journals usually document those that are not. Hence, AI software is almost free. In contrast, hardware requires physical machines, energy, and thus, money. Therefore, an organization's ability to access technology is a question of financial resources.

## 2. Business

AI is a problem-solving tool and uses data from the past to solve the problems of the future. Hence, an organization should only invest in AI,

* If it has data

* If the gains from AI solutions, benefits the organizations bottom line

This mix of data and business sense dictates if the organization has a business case for using AI. The second pillar.

## 3. People

Technology and business opportunities don't explore and exploit themselves. An organization needs skilled humans to perform this exploration and exploitation process.

Identifying problems that might benefit the organization's bottom-line, requires considerable domain knowledge. These problems need translation into a form that AI techniques might solve. The relevant technology pipelines need to be placed to solve these problems. The system as a whole needs monitoring, maintenance, and constant optimization.

Hence, AI depends most on this third and most crucial pillar: People.

## Anti-Patterns

An organization that does not have one or more of these pillars is unlikely to succeed at AI. Next, I discuss some specific examples of such "anti-pattern" organizations.

### The Outsourcer (Technology + Business, No People)

These companies have considerable financial resources, which enable them to invest in technology. They also have exciting business problems and AI-happy data. Unfortunately, they don't have the people expertise to build and exploit AI solutions. Hence, these companies outsource the people aspects of an AI system to third parties.

This approach has two serious dangers:

* Third parties have incomplete domain knowledge and imperfect incentives. Their solutions are never optimal.

* Third parties steal the organization's data. They sell it to competitors and engage in other conflicts of interest.

A variation of "The outsourcer" is the "Blind off-the-shelf user". These organizations live off off-the-shelf AI platforms from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Without paying heed to the consequences, the dangers are precisely the same.

### The Enthusiast (Technology + People, No Business)

Enthusiast organizations are like Outsourcers, in that they have financial resources. They also understand the importance of hiring good people. I.e. Machine learning engineers, data scientists, and domain experts.

Unfortunately (unlike Outsourcers), these companies don't have a business case for AI.

### The Poorman (Business + People, No Technology)

These organizations have both a compelling business case for AI and people. Unfortunately, they don't have the resources to invest in technology.

## Anti-Patterns (continued)

Each of the above examples lacks one pillar of AI. Many companies lack more:

* The Outsourcer Enthusiast (Only Technology). These invest in fancy technology without giving a thought about people or business.

* The Untapped Opportunity (Only Business). These organizations have a business case for AI. But have neither people nor resources to invest in technology.

* The AI Club (Only People). These organizations have neither a business case for AI nor technology. But they do have a group of people interested, even expert in AI. It is more of a social club for these people than an impact-making organization.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TsUv4bBSA6qjnMmOL0PCYA.png)

## Conclusion: Building Pillars

Of the three pillars, the business pillar is the only one innate to the nature of the organization. If this does not exist, the organization should not consider AI.

On the other hand, an organization can build the people and technology pillars from scratch: the former, by building an AI-savvy organization; the latter, by seeking investment.

Your organization might be one of these anti-patterns. If you lack the business pillar, then you should quit AI. If you do have a compelling business case, consider building the missing pillars.

# Where exactly is the "location"?

### Do we need an alternative address scheme for Sri Lanka?

## "I've come to the location" ("මම location එකට ආවා").

The following episode happens to me all the time; I'm sure it's also happened to you.

>>> I call an Uber. The Uber App notifies me that the driver is very close.

>>> Then the driver calls me and says: "I've come to the location" ("මම location එකට ආවා").

>>> I go to your meeting point, but the car is nowhere to be seen.

>>> I call the driver again, and ask him where he is.

>>> He replies: "I'm at the location" ("මම location එකේ").

Uber, other taxi/ride-sharing apps, as well as countless other applications from navigation to e-commerce, rely on GPS. In theory, GPS should be precise enough for Uber drivers and riders to meet at a same-enough location. Unfortunately, in practice, due to a combination of low-quality smartphones, expensive or poor internet connectivity, and obstructions like tall buildings, GPS is often not accurate enough for a comfortable app experience.

Hence, the humans in the loop have to make do with various offline information to make up for GPS's short-comings.

>>> Me: Where are you?

>>> Driver: I'm in front of Dialog office.

>>> Me: I'm on the other side of the road. In front of the big Mobitel Billboard, next to the PickMe CEO's house.

## The problem

GPS and the associate map and location data system, collectively answer two questions:

GPS answers the question:

* Question 1: "What is the latitude and longitude?"

Next, the map and location data system answers the question:

* Question 2: "What does this latitude and longitude mean in human language? I.e. Relative to addresses, landmarks, and buildings

In practice, the answer to Question 1, is not completely accurate. If it is more than (say) 10m off the mark, the humans have to answer another question:

* Question 3: "I need to get to get from this set of addresses, landmarks, or buildings to this other set of addresses, landmarks, or buildings, which, hopefully are not far away. How do I do that?"

For most parts of Sri Lanka, Question 2 is not a problem. Most apps have generally accurate maps and location information.

The Question 1 problem, is a technology problem. In the long term, as GPS, phones and network bandwidth improve, this problem should gradually go away. However, what do we do in the short term?

The obvious solution is to make it easier to answer Question 3.

## The problem with Question 3

If you were in Manhattan, where most of the roads are organized in streets and avenues, you can easily figure out how to get from the Museum of Art and Design (Corner of 8th avenue, and 58th street), to Carnegie Hall (7th and 57th).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AeaeuyVPfhKmFBwMxmZ87w.png)

But in Colombo or London, where most of the roads have grown and named "organically", you might have to resort to "Dialog buildings" and "Mobitel billboards". We also don't have consistent house or building numbering. For example, it is normal to have No. 14 following No. 20, with 22A, 22/5 and 22B/23 following that. Roads also have multiple equivalent names.

## Conclusion

The way around this problem might be to re-address all locations in Sri Lanka under some new scheme.

What do you, the reader, think? Should we invent something new?

# Wish you a long life!

### On different forms of greeting

ආයුබෝවන්!

In Sinhala (my native tongue), we formally greet people with the phrase ආයුබෝවන් (pronounced, āyubōvan), meaning "wish you a long life".

I was curious about how various peoples around the world greet each other, did a quick web search, and found this site which lists formal greetings in 50 languages.

Almost all greetings seem to fall into one of six groups:

* Good day (or variations like, Good Morning, Good Afternoon etc) [17/50]

* How are you? (how, hello, hi) [13/50]

* Good Health (be well, long life) [7/50]

* God (god is good, god be with you) [4/50]

* Homage [4/50]

* Peace [3/50]

Others ("I see you" in Zulu, and "East", referring to the morning sun, in Tsonga) [2/50]

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IX-6Rb5l8w_6QSenxp9I5A.png)

I wonder why different people chose these different greetings. It might indicate differences in what people consider most important (e.g. empathy, concern, health, God, respect, peace).

On the other hand, while ආයුබෝවන් (in the "Good Health" group) is the dominant formal greeting in Sinhala, we do have other greetings which fall into some of the other groups too.

* සුබ දවසක් (Good Day)

* කොහොමද? (How?)

* දෙවි පිහිටයි (God bless you), or the Buddhist equivalent බුදු සරණයි ( May you take refuge in the Buddha)

So, I suppose different people are not that different?

ආයුබෝවන්!

# Exam-itis

### And how to cure it

## The disease

I enjoyed my time at school, university, and grad-school. I enjoyed learning, and I met many friends and had many memorable experiences.

Exams, I didn't enjoy particularly. I was generally quite good at "tests", and so I didn't actually hate them. But I didn't like them either. They seemed a necessary evil that punctuated an otherwise good time.

They often felt unfair. Many classmates who were more intelligent and creative than me had worse grades. The converse was also true. Some folks who didn't seem particularly bright students got better grades than I did.

After starting work, I realised what had "felt" unfair, was unfair for real. In my profession at least, some of the most successful had ordinary exam records. And many with excellent records had average careers.

...

Research has proved time and time again that exams are, at best, a poor measure of future professional or academic success.

Exams are also competitive and stressful. Students often supplement regular classes with many rounds of private tuition. Recently, I met a student who had taken three tuition classes per subject for each of his three A. Level subjects. During his last year at school, he averaged three hours of sleep a night.

Worst of all, exams create contradictory incentives. At university, my batch-mates picked easy subjects that would guarantee them A+s. As opposed to choosing a hard subject, that might be more interesting or useful.

Hence, exams fail in all their capacities. They are, at best, poor measurements. They create bad incentives. All this at the cost of unnecessary stress and competition.

## The cause

But why do exams exist in the first place?

The first and primary reason is that people are either unwilling or unable to choose.

For example, many tech companies don't know how to hire a good software engineer (SWE). Because they don't know what a good SWE looks like. So they rely on the candidates A. Level results, or university GPA. They are unable to choose themselves, so they revert to exam results.

Universities often have a different problem. Many academics have a good sense of what makes a good undergraduate or grad student. But if they choose new entrants based on these criteria, they might face charges of bias or corruption. Hence, unwilling to choose, they default to exam results.

A second reason is historical.

Sri Lanka's educational system has its roots in the British order. The goal was to provide the sort of templated individual who could administer the vast Empire. Each graduate, from Toronto to Colombo, to Auckland was expected to do the same kind of things.

This same 200-year educational system builds around on competitive exams. Back then, it worked because the goal was simple. Produce a template civil servant. Today, we expect it to churn out as diverse individuals as possible. From computer scientists to micro-biologists to musicians and historians. What worked then, doesn't work now.

The third reason is financial. Exams are huge cash cows.

Public organisations conduct some exams. But most standardised tests, university accreditations, and all manner of degrees, diplomas, and certificates are granted by for-profit companies. Exam shops. Maximising shareholder value consists of fleecing poor students. Flogging off bogus degree certificates. They lobby governments and educational institutions to keep their qualifications relevant.

## The cure

Most people see exams as a means to a brighter economic future. Hence, employers must deal the first blow to exams. They should align their recruiting with factors that benefit their bottom line, not some arbitrary grade. Tech companies (for example) should get a better understanding of what a good SWE looks like. Then, hire those people. The best tech companies already do this. But others must also follow.

Universities should be truer to what makes a good undergraduate or post-graduate. They should move away from depending on one number excreted by an outdated system. A fairer system would consider exams as a necessary qualifier, not a sufficient one. Personality, experience, and knowledge of a broader field of subjects should factor. With a limited number of university vacancies, randomness is a better and fairer filter than most exams. In Sri Lanka, all citizens pay for free education. So why restrict higher education to those who are good at exams? Why not distribute vacancies among students who meet some basic bar by lottery?

Finally, the tyranny of exam granting shops should end. While educational debt is a growing problem, most exam shops have no incentive to prove that their diplomas are useful. A solution to this problem is to defer exam fees until after employment commences. If a graduate of a diploma in computing cannot be employed as a programmer (say), then the shop forgoes its fees.

## Concluding thoughts

For clarity, I've simplified a very complex problem. Its whole cannot be solved over-night. Also, some parts of the problem are more solvable than others. It is easier for a tech company hiring software engineers to overrule test scores than it is for a hospital hiring doctors.

But the principle is simple: It is time we see exams for what they are: a disease. There is a cure. But it is overdue.

# Meditation Diary

### Notes of a novice meditator

## 9/20

Fantasising in time (about past and future), and inner speech (associative thought) have one thing in common. Both acquire knowledge that assumes the permanence of certain concepts. Hence, ignorance of knowledge is wiser than ignorant knowledge.

The abstraction of breathing in and breathing out: It led me to believe that breathing was breathing in and breathing out. It is that, but so much more. I've let go of that abstraction.

## 9/19

Today, I used the five fetters — Sensual Desire (Kamaccanda), Ill-will (Viyapada), Sloth and Torpor (Tina Middha), Restless and Remorse (Uddacca Kukkucca), and Doubt (Vicikicca) — as a sort of mantra as I meditated.

Each time one of these emerged, I would make it my mantra. Each time another appeared, I would switch to that.

This practice helps me understand what fetters dominate my meditation.

# On Anti-Thought

### And the perils of meetings in tall buildings

Today, I had a meeting on one of the top floors of a high-rise building. At the ground-floor reception, I realised I didn't know which floor.

At this moment, a thought occurred to me. I thought, "I'll ask the receptionist!"

And so I asked the receptionist where such and such company was. And the receptionist said such and such floor.

So, I took the lift to that such and such floor.

...

In the lift, another thought occurred to me.

Before I had asked the receptionist, I had to think: "On which floor is my meeting?"

But after she replied, I didn't need to think. I knew!

I had knowledge. And that knowledge had taken away my need to think. The Dr. Jekyll of Knowledge had spawned a grotesque side-kick — the Mr. Hyde of anti-thought!

...

And then, a third, darker thought occurred.

The receptionist could have been mistaken. What I thought knowledge might be ignorance. I might be heading to the wrong floor, the wrong company, and the wrong meeting. A completely wrong future!

And what about other things I think I know? Other forms of knowledge which might be ignorance?

I might be nonchalantly basking in the light of my supposed-knowledge, while hurtling towards a spectre of darkeness and certain doom. And thanks to anti-thought, I might not be able to defend myself!

# On not doing meditation

### And what Descartes might have said

## Doing

Verbs are often explained as "doing-words" to small children learning English. When you think, you "do thinking". When you walk, you "do walking".

But, when you meditate, do you "do meditating"?

Not quite. At least according to some instruction I received.

To meditate, I was told to sit still and do nothing.Or in other words, I was to do "not doing". I should have been able to describe myself as,

>>> "I do not do".

But how can one do not doing? Because if one is doing, one does. And if one is not doing, one does not.

But from the pure experience of meditation, it seemed perfectly possible to do "not doing". But logically, and syntactically, the phrase "I do not do" seemed paradoxical.

## Being

And then I realised the problem. I was not doing not doing.

There was a higher verb at play: Being. And when one is "being" one doesn't necessarily have to be "doing" anything.

Hence, I should have said, "I be not do".

Or more grammatically,

>>> "I am. But I am not doing".

And this can be applied to all types of doing, like thinking.

>>> "I am. But I am not thinking".

Or as Rene Descarte might have said,

>>> "Ego sum. Sed non cogitabat".

So, I suppose not all verbs are doing words. Some are also "being" words.

## Not being?

We went from doing verbs to being verbs. But what about beyond being verbs?

# On Climate Change

### Some bad statistics

Sri Lanka has appeared at the top of the Global Climate Risk Index in the last couple of years.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2aavchp5nJ3DELQh6_SK0g.jpeg)

The 2019 report said,

>>> In May 2017, heavy landslides and floods occurred in Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains in southwestern regions of the country. More than 200 people died after the worst rains on the Indian Ocean island since 2003. The monsoons displaced more than 600 000 people from their homes and 12 districts were affected. The inland southwest district of Ratnapura was most affected where over 20 000 people faced flash floods.

The Global Climate Risk Index is based on the number of deaths resulting from climate-related disasters.

One problem with Climate Change is that there is a misalignment of who is able to solve the problem, and who is willing to solve the problem. To visualize this, I plotted Carbon Dioxide emissions vs the deaths from climate-related disasters.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*O2_h0fPMPPrEujC1CRDMEA.png)

[The linear trend-line appears curved, because the Axis have been scaled logarithmically]

The countries of the world fall into four groups:

* Problem, No Solution. Countries like Haiti, that are affected by disasters, but don't have significant emissions. These countries have a problem, but no solution.

* Problem and Solution. Countries like India, China and the US that are both affected by disasters, and have significant emissions. These countries have both a problem but are also able to influence the solution.

* Solution, No Problem. Countries like Canada that produce large amounts of emissions, but have not been affected by disasters as much. They can influence the solution, but don't have much of an incentive.

* Everyone else.

## Bad Statistics

### Y = mX + C + Error

The number of deaths from climate disasters, is weakly correlated with CO₂ emmission mass (R² = 0.2812). The linear relationship is:

>>> Deaths = 0.107 * Emissions + 23.85

The weak correlation is bad news. But on the other hand, some correlation is heartening. It is particularly good that big emitters like India, China and the US have recently felt the wrath of several Climate change related natural disasters.

### US = (Canada + Haiti) / 2

On the other hand, these are big countries, and the distribution of deaths and emissions are highly skewed. In the US, for example, poor populations around the Gulf of Mexico, have been disproportionately effected by natural disasters like hurricanes. Hence, while the US as a whole might be "Problem and Solution", it might be completely fragmented into many populations of "Solution, No Problem" and "Problem, No Solution". In other words, the US might be a collection of Canadas and Haitis.

### Deaths = 0

The Maldives had no deaths from climate disasters in 2016. And hence, doesn't even appear on the plot. On the other hand, it would almost certainly be decimated by rising sea-levels. This is a particular case of a general problem. The effects of things like emissions take several decades to cause deaths and other harmful effects. We don't have useful statistics that predict the future impact of Climate Change.

### CO₂ + what?

CO₂ emissions are not the only way countries harm the environment. Many other factors contribute. Hence, similarly, we don't have useful statistics to aggregate all the causes of Climate Change either.

## Concluding Thought

Given that we are generally bad and quantifying both causes and effects, I wonder to what extent this badness of statistics will effect our ability or inability to solve the Climate Change problem.

# Data is Different

### On the value of data

Suppose you give me a $10 note. I take a look at it, then immediately return it, back to you.

Now, what happened during this double transaction?

The supply of $10 notes remains unchanged. The value of the $10 bill is still the same. I am as wealthy as I was before the transaction. And so are you.

Now, suppose you give me your credit card. I take a look at it, then immediately return it, back to you.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iqNBmACymmWiolniII1YeA.png)

Before, only you knew your credit card number, its date of expiry, and its security code. You were the only person who possessed this data.

But afterwards, I also know. The "supply" of credit card data has doubled. First, only you had a copy. But now, I also have a copy. Before, I had no credit card — and hence, I was poor. But now, I can use your number to buy anything I like — I am rich. Before, the card was secure. After, it is compromised. For you, before, it had value. After, it must be cancelled and hence has no value.

## Aphorisms on the value of data

Data has value. But it differs from physical valuables (PVs — like a $10 note) in several ways.

* During a transaction, the supply of PVs is conserved. The supply of data multiplies by the number of parties involved. If you give your data to one person, its supply doubles. If you give it to two people it triples. If you share it on the internet, it multiples several million times.

* During a transaction, the value of PVs conserves. The value of data dilutes.

* An individual would be rational to buy a PV if the incremental value they get from the PV exceeds its price. For example, if I consider a shirt more valuable to me than its $10 price tag, it is rational for me to buy the shirt. The same applies to data. I can do useful things with data. That value determines the data's price. The act of buying is a transaction, and transactions dilute the value of data. Hence, the value of what I can do with the data is likely to diminish by my act of buying it. For example, I might believe that I can buy goodies worth $1000s with your credit card. But our transaction (the fact that I handled it) might influence you to cancel it. And thus its value goes to zero.

* The same applies to selling data. There is value gained, but also value lost by dilution.

* The utility of most PVs is sub-linear. As you own more supply, the incremental value of a unit diminishes. For example, to a pauper, a $10 note could be the difference between life and death by starvation. To a billionaire, it is equal to a strip of lavatory-paper. The utility of data is super-linear. The more data you have, the more incremental value you can get from a unit. For example, you have little or no use for the data which results from you clicking on an Ad on Google, or Facebook. Conversely, these tech giants do have use, because they can combine it with large amounts of similar and dissimilar data.

* A corollary of sub-linear utility is that the natural tendency of most PVs is to dissipate. The natural tendency of data (which has super-linear utility), is to concentrate. Many people have $10 bills. Only a few have horrendous amounts of data.

# Knowing, Not Knowing, and Learning

### On Tagines, Liszt, and Programming

Suppose you want to do something. Cook a Moroccan Tagine, master Un Sospiro, or code in a new programming language.

Two fetters get in the way of your doing: Knowing and Not Knowing.

If you think you already know how to cook a Tagine, you'll burn the meat. If you think you don't know, you'll never get as far as the kitchen.

"But wait", I hear you say. "If I already know, why would I burn the meat?"

There is a stark difference between knowing to do something and doing something. When we say we know how to do something, we've abstracted the task into a set of steps, which we know. Knowing consists of a finite number of abstract steps. Doing something consists of an infinite number of concrete moments.

Not knowing is precisely the same as knowing. We abstract the problem into a finite set of steps, which we claim not to know, or unable to do. The knowledge of the lack of knowledge is still knowledge.

The only way to do something is to stop thinking about knowing or not knowing and to do it. When one does without thinking, one is not shackled by knowledge or the lack of it. One ends up, not only doing, but also free to absorb and internalize all the infinite concrete moments of the task. In other words, one learns.

Some of the worst coders know a lot about one single programming language, usually Java. At the same time, they don't want to learn anything else. They are as proud of what they know, as they are of what they don't know. They invent all manner of ludicrous excuses to justify their knowledge. Python is for kids. C++ is a NASA Conspiracy. Go doesn't exist.

Franz Liszt, arguably the most celebrated pianist who ever lived, and composer of Un Sospiro, practised the piano daily for hours on end. While he possessed virtuosic ability, each day, he hoped to learn something new.

This is the only way to do anything. Forget what you know or don't know. Not only will you learn, but you might also learn something that has never before been known. This type of learning is called creativity.

# O. Levels 2.0

### If I redesigned my exams

Our education system is a ladder. Through school and university, we ascend a set of wrungs. O. Levels, A. Levels, Final Year Exams etc.

At 16, like many Sri Lankans of that age, I took the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level exam. Better known as O. Levels. I took Sinhala Language and Literature, my first language, determined by birth ethnicity. The compulsory English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies and History. Buddhism determined by birth religion. Commerce and Accounting, the elective "technical" subject. Western Music, the elective aesthetic subject.

I got distinctions or "D"s for each of these subjects, and like many, ascended the wrung to the GCE Advanced Level class.

The problem with this ladder was that ascending wrungs required demonstrating knowledge. Not learning. There was a large amount of stuff that one had to know. And if one knew, one climbed to the next wrung. One could complete the trip with little or no learning. Kindergarten to university and beyond.

In this article, I look back at my O. Levels and try to redesign it to focus the wrungs on learning and not knowledge.

## Why I liked Sinhala

Sinhala was my favourite subject during O. Levels. While I didn't understand the reason for it then, upon reflection, I do now.

It was because it consisted of writing essays. And not just essays, but poems, and critiques, and other "creative" things. One not only learnt to create, one was examined on these things.

I was good at Mathematics, but I found the exams at best boring, and at worst stressful. They consisted of solving a large number of easy problems, racing against the clock. There was no creativity. Merely rote-learned "pattern matching".

Conversely, with Sinhala, I would often leave exams energized and motivated, because I'd created something (usually the essay) that was new. Often, I'd go back and re-read my essay after I received it post-correction. I'd never re-read my mathematics paper.

The whole Sinhala paper didn't consists of essays. All forms of "creative composition" probably made about 60% of the paper. The remaining 40% consisted of rote-learned, pattern matching. Grammar and esoteric theory, which I found as tedious. But, at least the 60% existed, and that made the exam worthwhile.

I talk about exams. And "education is not just about exams" you say. But exams determine what actually gets done. We are what we measure. A rotten measure leads to rotten humans.

## How I began to like Mathematics

My boredom with Mathematics began to change on the next wrung. While O. Level mathematics was memory and regurgitation, A. Level mathematics introduced complex problems. This complexity ensured that there were several ways of solving a problem. They required knowledge from varying parts of mathematics. On one occasion, my teacher claimed he'd never seen my solution to a trigonmetry problem, in 30 years of teaching. Such things were possible and exciting.

The A. Level Combined Mathematics (a mix of pure and applied mathematics) paper, was still dull. About 80% of the paper was still "pattern matching". But the remaining 20% made some amends.

On the next wrung, my first year at university, the boredom completely vanished. My papers in algebra, geometry, calculus, logic etc. consisted entirely of solving hard problems. Time was never a barrier, only complexity. 20% grew to 100%.

By then, I could safely say that I loved mathematics.

## Themes and Ideas

The reason so much of the O. Levels consisted of "pattern matching" was that it tried to test knowledge. One had to know specific patterns, and one's ability to match demonstrated this knowledge.

It was easy to know "stuff" without learning. And without learning, it was impossible to be creative. Conversely, with the Sinhala essay, and the complex mathematical problems, one had to be creative. And to be creative, one had to have learnt.

Hence, the core of an education system that tests learning, instead of knowledge, is one based on examining creativity, not rote-learning.

## O. Levels 2.0

If I were to re-invent my O. Levels based on these principles, all exams would consist of only:

* Essays (and variations)

* Complex Problems

Applying these principles, each of my eight subjects would look like this:

* Sinhala: Given that Sinhala exams were already 60% "learning compliant", we merely need to get rid of the rote-learning components, like multiple choice questions (MCQs) testing grammar. It is impossible to write a good essay with lousy grammar; hence, the 40% is redundant anyway.

* English: As Sinhala.

* Mathematics: Move away from a O.Level-esque "pattern-matching" to Univeristy-esque complex problems.

* Science: Science consisted of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Physics and Chemistry, in particular, can have complex problems. All three can have essays. For example, "What if stomach fluid was not an acid, but a base", or "What if the earth's gravity was twice as strong", or "Why do different animals have different types of teeth" etc. The list is endless. And a lot more fun.

* Social Studies and History, Buddhism, Commerce and Accounting: Essays, and complex problems in the form of case studies, about real-world scenarios.

* Western Music. Essays and musical composition

## Two Takeaways

"But wait! All this will be very expensive!" you say.

MCQs and "pattern-matching" exams are cheap. Examiners don't have to spend hours reading tedious essays or reviewing the workings of complex problems. They can even leave it to a machine.

It might be too expensive to be practical. I don't know.

But there is something else you can take away.

Suppose you sat for your O. Levels (or your child sat for O. Levels, or you employed someone who has eight distinctions at the O. Levels). The ability to write a good essay in Sinhala or English is better than a "D" for the subject. Ditto for the other subjects.

Even if the conventional education system does not test your (or your child's, or your employee's) learning, using my "examination marking scheme" (essays etc.) you can.

There is a darker takeaway.

If our education is based more and more in exams that machines can grade, then we will end-up spawning a generation of mechanical humans that robots can replace. This will happen whether or not the alternatives are expensive.

AI apocalypse now!

# Open Plan Offices (OPOs)

### 7 Tips on making the best of them

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XX-cgE7DzmFnHApfEo74EA.jpeg)

Open Plan Offices (OPOs), particularly at tech companies, are controversial.

Foes claim that they are a cheap ploy by profit-hungry companies to cut costs, they are noisy, and they result in less productive employees. Fans claim that they foster creativity, and community, and, ultimately, result in more productivity.

I'm not going to argue for one side or the other.

Instead, let's assume that you already work in an OPO (like I do), and don't see this changing for some time. How can you make the best of it?

## 1. "Do not disturb"

One of the most common complaints with OPOs: "Co-workers are disturbing me".

In most of these cases, the disturber does not realise that you're concentrating hard on something. A simple fix for this problem is to have a "Do not disturb" sign or convention. For example, having your headphones on, or placing an object on your monitor.

## 2. Noise-cancelling headphones

There are some excellent products around, and they are continually getting cheaper.

An alternative to the sometimes cumbersome headphones is in-ear earphones. I like the blue-tooth version, which also increases your freedom of movement.

## 3. Silent work areas

Sometimes, your noise-cancelling headphones or do-not-disturb signs are not enough. Some work needs focussed concentration and absolute silence.

Companies should have a few silent cubicles, or pods, or altogether "silent" zones for this purpose.

## 4. Partial OPOs

Sometimes, you want to restrict the openness of the OPO, partially, but not completely.

Placing Japanese panels or plants in various parts of the office restricts the "traffic" around the office, and creates the illusion of partial cubicles.

## 5. Silent time

I like to keep the times of the day when I'm most productive (usually the morning) to my self when I can do deep work. Conversely, I schedule meetings and less productive work for times of the day when I'm less productive.

The company can designate various times of the day (e.g. 8 am to 11 am), as "silent" periods. Talk and disruption can be minimised.

## 6. Noise zones

Often people are disturbed by co-workers talking between themselves or on the phone.

If there is a designated "noise zone", away from the desks and in some public area (like a micro-kitchen), talkers and phone-callers can conduct their business, without disturbing anyone.

## 7. Meta: Rules

Most companies don't have an OPO policy — a basic set of rules that all employees should follow. Many OPO problems stem from this deficiency.

Conversely, if all employees are aware of the OPO rules, if new employees are educated, and if employees are reminded of these rules (a list stuck on a wall), many of these problems can be avoided.

# Love in the time of uncertainty

### Featuring The Black Eyed Peas, Rumi, and ප-ප රප ප-ම්

How does a person treat another person? It usually depends on who the other is. Various cultures have various codes on how to treat various people. Some codes apply to only people close to you — like friends and family. Some codes extend to even the extremes of people — like criminals and enemies. For example, most cultures look down upon executing surrendering soldiers. Some codes extend beyond the human species to animals and plants.

Codes build upon philosophical ideas and assumptions about the world.

Reciprocity is a common assumption. If we don't execute our enemy's soldiers, they won't execute our soldiers. The Golden Rule generalises this idea:

>>> "Treat others as you would like others to treat you". Or "Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated".

Another assumption is group identity. If you want to belong to a group, you must behave in a certain way. If you ill-treat members of your group, the group will banish you.

Both reciprocity and group identity depend on incentives and enforcement. If one didn't care about banishment, or the group has no power to banish, one could behave with impunity. This is a problem.

Is there a code on how to treat people based on the individual and not the collective? One that comes from within. As opposed to without.

## An individualistic code (from first principles)

As with collectivistic codes, an individualistic code must start somewhere. With some assumptions about the world.

I believe in only one philosophical assumption about the world: Everything is uncertain. People, Ideas, Nations. Everything.

How might we build a code from this principle?

### 1. In good times and bad

If everything is uncertain, then there is no difference between good times and bad times. Random uncertainty causes both. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat you one way or another way all because times are good, or times are bad.

### 2. Your bad time is my bad time

Since bad times are a result of uncertainty, the cause of your bad times is the same as the cause of my bad times.

If some bad time befell you, it is only a matter of time before something similar happens to me. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat your bad time as your problem, and not my problem.

As John Donne said,

>>> No man is an island entire of itself....And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

### 3. Your good time is my good time

Ditto. The rationale is the same as for bad times.

### 4. May you and I have good times

If everything is uncertain, there is no point pretending that the future will be good or bad. But why not hope for the best? And not just for me, but equally for you also?

With the above, there is the question of what good and bad mean. For a serial killer, murdering babies might be "good". But I don't mean this type of relative good and bad. I mean absolute good and bad. What absolute means is a whole new topic. I have briefly approached it in On Justice and On Freedom from Freedom. For now, I'll assume that you (dear reader) are good enough and your good is good enough for me.

## Where is the love?

You might have noticed that these principles are hardly original. They map closely to the Four Brahmaviharas of Buddhism. However, there is no good English word for "Brahmaviharas". So I'll just call them "Love". Shall I?

And it's not only Buddhism. These same concepts are the core of the Christian Marriage wows, and isn't marriage supposed to be about love?

>>> I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.

Rumi, himself an Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic, describes love much like this:

>>> The garden of love is green without limit and yields many fruits other than sorrow or joy. Love is beyond either condition: without spring, without autumn, it is always fresh.

Even Aristotle referred to the union of the good times and bad times of two people as:

>>> Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.

Hence, my definition justifies, methinks.

## 🎵 ප-ප රප ප-ම් 🎺

But apologies, if you expected something streamy about sexual love or romantic love. You might feel betrayed by my self-definition of love, instead of going with what all the pop-songs are going-on about.

But then, there's a lot more to love. And if we realise this, perhaps most of our problems will go away?

>>> All you need is love 🎵 ප-ප රප ප-ම් 🎺

>>> All you need is love🎵 ප-ප රප ප-ම් 🎺

>>> All you need is love, love

>>> Love is all you need

# The Center of Sri Lanka

### And different ways of defining it

## Centre of Bounding Box

Question: What is so special about this point on Kandalama Lake?

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eOdbFt9qn0mynk-ddhIV7A.png)

Here's a clue: It's latitude and longitude are 7.877083N, 80.697917E.

Answer: If you draw a bounding box using Sri Lanka's extreme points (Point Pedro to the orth, Dondra Head to the south, Sangaman Kanda Point to the east, and Kachchatheevu Island to the west), this point would be dead center.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3-zl5WOem4ZKtRIlWiq0Wg.png)

Note, this is different from the Centre of Geography, which involves some more complex calculations.

## Center of Population

Sri Lanka's population is skewed towards the south west of the Island. If you factor this in, and compute the Centre of Population, it would be 7.211559N, 80.427956E, or somewhere near Aranayaka in the Kegalle District.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iiY3-Pex5YTOZdXclObFKQ.png)

Note, that, obviously, this is to the south and west of Kandalama.

## Where to locate an office in Colombo (Revisited)

In Where to locate an office in Colombo, I looked at travel time to six potential "office locations" in Greater Colombo, from various other parts of Greater Colombo.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f739S7l5Kvs1_oYeTB35-Q.png)

One problem with my analysis was that it didn't factor in population density, and travel volume:

>>> "The optimal location was that which as many people could travel to and from with least difficulty" — this visualization only factors travel time. It does not factor the density of population, and hence travel volume of various locations. One location could have a large "quick to travel" zone (Blue/Green), which is sparsely populated, while another location could have a small "quick to travel" zone which is densly populated, and hence with more travel volume.

To better answer this question (but still not perfectly), I extended the "centre of population" idea to look at the population distributions around the six "office locations".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u255uL7yDIt4lysWH05hNw.png)

If one were to target a 1km travel radius, then Thunmulla and Narahenpita Junction, would be the best option, because about over 100,000 people lived within a 1km radius of these "office locations".

Thunmulla would be the best location until around 6km, when The Parliment, with a cumulative population of around 1M people, would be the best location.

After 12km, Malabe Town, with a comulative population of around 2.3M people, would be the best location.

## Center of Travel Time

Obviously, what we really want is a "Center of Travel Time". Traveling 6km to one place, might take longer than travelling 12km to another. But that involves some pulling a lot of data from the Google Maps API, which I will leave for later.

# Engis (Part 1)

### The Murder of Queen Elizabeth II

There are at least two problems with the English language.

* Pronunciation: There is no deterministic relationship between words and sound

* Grammar: It is far too complicated

In a series of articles, we will solve these problems, by inventing a new language: En-gis.

This article, is the first in the series, where we will solve the problem of English Pronunciation.

## Alphabet Soup

As a preliminary step to solving pronunciation, let's clean-up the abomination that is the English Alphabet.

The English Alphabet has two problems:

* The letters are not in any particular order. For example, the vowels A, E, I, O, U appear all over the place

* There are redundant letters. Why should we have a W, given that we already have a V? And what's the use of a Q when we have a perfectly serviceable K? And don't even get me started on X. Is that even a sound?

Hence, let's start with putting the vowels at the beginning:

A E I O U

Next, let's omit redundant letters: W (sounds like V), Q (sounds like K), X (sounds like nothing on earth).

Finally, let's organize the remaining consonants in order of sound:

* Palette sounds: K G

* Hard palette sounds: C J

* Alveolar ridge sounds: T D N

* Lip sounds: P B M

* Other sounds: Y R L V S H F Z

Hence, are new 23 letter A to Z is:

A E I O U K G C J T D N P B M Y R L V S H F Z

Much better.

## Vowels

Since we have only five vowels, we can have only 5 vowel sounds. Hence, let's choose the most intuitive sounds, given the five vowel letters:

* "At"

* "Egg"

* "It"

* "Of"

* "fUll"

Let's restrict ourselves to "short" vowel sounds, and ignore all other vowel sounds and diphthong.

## Consonants

* Kit, Git

* Chat, Jack

* Tick, Dick, Nick

* Pun, Bun, Mum

* Yum, Rum, Lat, Vat, Sat, Hat, Fat, Zoo

Just as we ignore most vowel sounds, we will ignore all combinations of consonents.

And we are done.

## Example: Translating words from English to Engis

Before:

>>> Send her victorious,

>>> Happy and glorious,

>>> Long to reign over us,

>>> God save the Queen!

After:

>>> Sen he viktorius,

>>> Hapi an gorius,

>>> Lon to ren ove us,

# Multi-Ethnic Sri Lanka

### Some Visualizations

In this article, I present a series of maps, that visualize Sri Lanka's ethnic make-up.

The data is based on the 2012 census. For simplicity, I focus on Sinhala, Tamil (Sri Lankan Tamils and Indian Tamils aggregated), and Muslim (Moors and Malays aggregated) ethnicities.

## Province

At the provincial level, Sri Lanka's ethnicity is binary. A Sinhala dominated South, and a Tamil dominated North. While the eastern province contains a Tamil plurality, its demographics are far more diverse than the Northern province.

There was no province with a Muslim plurality.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KEOxFn_JXsfss1mZNEEW1A.png)

## District

At the district level, there are five types of ethnic zones:

* Sinhala >90%: North Central Province, Southern Province, Kurunegala, Gampaha, and Moneragala

* Sinhala > 50%: Sabaragamuwa Province, Puttalam, Colombo, Kalutara, Matale, Kandy, and Badulla

* Muslim plurality: Trincomalee and Ampara

* Tamil > 50%: The rest of the Northern Province, Batticaloa, and Nuwara-Eliya

* Tamil > 90%: Jaffna and Kilinochchi

There is no district, where more than 50% of the population is Muslim. Trincomalee and Ampara have a Muslim plurality, but not a majority (i.e. > 50%). As we will see next, at the next level of granularity (Divisional Secretariat Level), there are areas with >90% and >50% muslim populations.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Tpb8-9kDMoO1lVSc9ZxJrA.png)

## Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD)

Going another level deeper, at the Divisional Secretariat Division level, an obvious observation is that much of the country is mono-ethnic.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Gqv12XEdvjc2SsjaR_4eWg.png)

For the purpose of this visualisation, I define a mono-ethnic DSD where >90% of the population is from one ethnicity.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uVwazG7u0qHREYqR5XFGsw.png)

## 2nd most common Ethnicity

In this visualisation, we ignore the mono-ethnic DSDs and visualize the next most common ethnicity.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JQTMgwl7MMqHDrrNaQXHfw.png)

And similarly, by district:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MmzCQ3Ib5DcnUWGm5dwStQ.png)

## Multi-Ethnicness Index

To measure, "multi-ethnic-ness", I used the proportion of population from the least popular ethnicity. For example, if some area is 40% Sinhala, 30% Tamil and 25% Muslim, it's multi-ethnic-ness would be 25%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cybRuhN1WjXXagp9OtzNcg.png)

Similarly, I also looked at the proportion of the second most common ethnicity:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lPO3nBItCM_pQnft3IyaSg.png)

Hence, while much of Sri Lanka is mono-ethnic, there are several pockets of highly multi-ethnic areas.

These multi-ethnicity metrics are diluted when expanded to district and province levels, because they fail to capture more subtle patterns.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UBr7f7AU9Zp1ZJ5B-cEy4A.png)

For example, Trincomalee might seem multi-ethnic with at least 27% Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people. However, on closer inspection, it is obvious that these populations are isolated.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UZOTucijhpYuS4iADla0fw.png)

## In Colombo

Except for the Colombo DSD, which has a Muslim plurality, most of Colombo has a Sinhala Majority, most of which is mono-ethnic.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xRHIaAPjHws0jLBZow7TZw.png)

Zooming in on the Colombo Municipal Council area (which consists of the Colombo and Thimbirigasyaya DSDs), and the Kotte MC, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia MC, and the Kolonnawa Urban Council, there is a lot more ethnic diversity.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_e1ECn_e5QZgTy_OvSvU0w.png)

## Appendix: What happened to the others?

The 2012 census included Burghers, Chettys, Barathas and and other ethnic groups. I excluded these from my analysis, because no district had more than 1% of these groups combined.

#### Article 122 · October 1, 2019

# Flags of the World

### And asking machines difficult questions

## Supervised and unsupervised learning

>>> "How many categories of flags are there there in the world?"

You might say,

>>> "Some flags are red, white and blue. Some are yellow, green and red. Some have only one colour. Others have many colors."

But what if we ask a computer this question? An unusual question to ask a machine, because usually, we ask machines other questions. Like,

>>> "Here's a picture of a face. Can you tell me who it is?"

Or

>>> "Here's some data about this person who turned up on a website. What advert should we show them?"

Or

>>> "Here's a video from the front camera. Is that a lorry ahead of us?"

All these questions have one thing in common. The computer learns to answer a question, by training itself on previous examples. Similar questions and correct answers. To train a computer to recognise a face, we would provide it with millions of images of faces, together with a label (E.g. "Albert Einstein"). Hence, when a friend uploads a picture of Albert, Facebook can tag him.

This type of learning based on examples is called supervised learning. Most of Artificial Intelligence consists of supervised learning.

But asking a computer "How many categories of flags are there there in the world?", does not consist of learning based on examples. You might provide the computer with images of flags. But you don't give it any right answers. The computer will have to go off an learn what are the categories of flags for itself. Without human help.

This type of learning, without human help, is known as unsupervised learning.

## K-Means

So I decided to ask my computer the question.

One common unsupervised learning method is clustering. In our example, the computer will go and group similar flags. Each group becomes a type. One simple clustering algorithm is k-means clustering.

The computer starts with the items to cluster. In our example, flags. It goes to Wikipedia, and downloads about 200 flags from various countries and territories.

I decide to make things easier for the machine by asking it to categorise flags only based on colour. Ignoring things like shape of the flag, objects like animals etc. Hence, for each flag, the computer notes what colours exist, and what proportion of each colour.

For example, the Sri Lankan flag consists of about 36% yellow, 32% maroon, 11% orange, 11% green, and various smaller amounts of other colors.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eHo_sJaWjUQVydfqK0QtTA.png)

Once the flags are ready, the computer runs the k-means algorithm.

We must first specify how many categories the computer should find. Let us say seven categories.

The computer picks seven flags at random, and then finds how the other flags are similar to these flags. Those flags join the groups of the first seven flags.

For each group, we find the "mean flag". A "mean flag" is the flag that you would get if you averaged all the flags together. For example, here is a representation of the Sri Lanka Flag, the British Flag, and their mean:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JQ6yFYIsW7QQUl2CRBzvIw.png)

The computer then finds how the other flags are similar to these mean flags. With each step, the clustering improves. And on and on. When we are happy with the categories, we stop.

So how did my computer do?

## The Results

### 1. Pan-Arab Colors

The first cluster consisted of White, Black, Green and Red. Also known as the Pan-Arab colours. Including the flags of Jordan, Palestine, Kuwait and the UAE.

The cluster also had a bit of yellow and blue, which combined with red to admit flags like Andora and Moldova.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cBHmhBmnXIGOSVvqUeHv9g.png)

### 2. Red, White and Blue

The second cluster consisted mostly of Red, White and Blue. Including France, the UK, the USA, and the Netherlands.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FnVLt5vANGzCC__vSXjZYA.png)

### 3. Pan-African Colors

The third cluster consisted of Red, Yellow and Green, also known as the Pan-African colours. This also included some non-African flags like Sri Lanka.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ViwP0YXDhgywI0Xg2vkNUg.png)

### 4. Red

The fourth cluster consisted of flags that were dominated by red, including China, Turkey, and Vietnam.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2ZSyVfIugixHZAOvrzsYPA.png)

### 5. Lighter Blue

The fifth cluster consisted of flags with lighter shades of blue, including Greece and Honduras. It also had a little yellow and green which admitted Sweden and Gabon.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Dl6_53UZ2pSRlRFI_NOXVw.png)

### 6. Dark Blue and Green

The sixth cluster was dominated by dark blue and green. Including New Zealand and Bangladesh.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rs5hUjpNlnXCkLUqZa2ZBA.png)

### 7. White

The last cluster was dominated by white. It included the flags of India, Japan, South Korea, Finland and Israel.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4vmOkxEL28wbr-vPcd4P9g.png)

## Concluding Thoughts

Obviously, my computer had not heard about Pan-African leagues or Red-White-And-Blues. These were my own annotations. But it is uncanny how it picked up these patterns.

On the other hand, these clusters do include some noise that humans would not have included. For example, in addition to the dominant colours, each cluster included some "minority" colours, that introduced some "rogue" flags.

On yet another hand, we could choose to see this as the computers "opinion". It has devised a new type of flag, which humans might not have agreed with, or come up with.

# A Brief History of Sri Lankan Presidential Elections

### From 1982 to the present

The 2019 presidential election is scheduled for Saturday the 16th of November. Hence, I thought it an excellent time to reflect on the seven previous elections.

## Before 1982

The office of President was created in 1972 within Sri Lanka's first republican constitution. The then Governer-General of Ceylon, William Gopallawa became the first president of Sri Lanka. While the President replaced the British sovereign as head of state, the prime minister was still head of government.

In 1977, following a landslide victory in the parliamentary election, the UNP won 140 of 168 seats in parliament. With the second amendment to the constitution that followed in 1978, Sri Lanka moved to an executive presidential system of government where the President was both head of state, and head of government. The amendment also made the incumbent prime minister, J.R. Jayawardena, President. Hence, our first executive president took the post without a Presidential Election.

## 1982 — The First Ever

Sri Lanka's first ever presidential election was held on the 20th of October 1982.

UNP candidate and incumbent President Jayawardena won with 52.91% of the vote, winning 137 of the 160 polling divisions, similar to the 1977 parliamentary election landslide. Former Minister for Agriculture and Lands Hector Kobbekaduwa, the SLFP candidate, won 39.07%, winning 15 electoral divisions. Some caricatured the election as a capitalism vs. socialism fight, with President Jayawardena's open market reforms, following the socialist policies of the 1970–1977 SLFP government.

Marxist and revolutionary Rohana Wijeweera of the JVP won 4.19%. Kumar Ponnambalam of the ACTC won 2.67%, winning eight polling divisions mostly in Jaffna.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ftQDA9aQNtORwLUxCgi9Pg.png)

[This map is an Abstract Cartogram of Sri Lanka. Each box represents one of the 160 polling divisions. The label denotes the district. For example, "Co" denotes Colombo. Read more at Visualizing Election Results. Margin indicates by what % of votes the winning party won that polling district.]

## 1988 — Amid Chaos

The 1988 Presidential Election was held amid two bloody conflicts: One with the LTTE in the north and east. The other with the JVP in many other parts of the country. As a result of President Jayawardena's Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Indian peace-keeping forces had also entered the country. Unsurprisingly, turnout was only 55.32%, down from 81.06% in 1982. Voting was not held in LTTE controlled parts of the country.

The incumbent prime minister and UNP candidate Ranasinghe Premadasa won the presidency with 50.43% of the vote. Former prime minister and SLFP candidate Sirimavo Bandaranaike won 44.95%.

Oswin Abeygunasekara of the SLPP won 4.63%. He also won four polling divisions. This was the last instance where a "third candidate" won any polling divisions.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pVdj-bTohr__IRUaXfW7_g.png)

## 1994 — Change, please

On May Day 1993, President Premadasa was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber at the UNPs May Day rally. Prime Minister D. B. Wijetunga was sworn in six days later as acting President.

The following year, President Wijetunga chose not to run in the Presidential Election, and, hence, the UNPs selected Gamini Dissanayake as their presidential candidate. However, on the 24th of October, just 16 days before the election, Dissanayake was himself assassinated by the LTTE, at a campaign meeting. Probably hoping to capitalize on a sympathy vote, the UNP chose Dissanayake's widow Srima as the replacement candidate, overlooking former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

In the meantime, in August 1994, the incumbent UNP had lost the parliamentary election, after holding the legislature for 17 years since 1977. The new prime minister was Chandrika Kumaratunga, leader of the SLFP, and daughter of former Prime Ministers S.W.R.D. and Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was the SLFP's obvious presidential candidate.

Kumaratunga won 62.28% of the vote, to Srima Dissanayake's 35.91%, winning all but the Mahiyanganaya polling division. This is the closest a presidential candidate has come to winning all 160 polling divisions.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4pIm0gFPXMmsTk36B6EOKA.png)

## 1999 — Early polls

Given the six-year presidential term, elections were not due until 2000. However, President Kumaratunga called for early elections in 1999. The candidate from the opposition UNP was former prime minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.

After surviving an assassination attempt by the LTTE three days before the election, where she lost the use of an eye, Kumaratunga won a second term with 51.12% of the vote. Wickramasinghe won 42.71%, while Nandana Gunathilake of the JVP won 4.08%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZJwcTidNSiSKfGYecuBJ9g.png)

## 2005 — The nail-biter

Earlier in the year, President Kumaratunga filed a lawsuit arguing that, since the 1999 presidential election happened an year earlier, an extra year should be added to her second six-year term, postponing the next presidential election to 2006. However, the supreme court rejected this claim, and elections were scheduled for the 17th of November 2005.

Having served two terms, President Kumaratunga could not contest another presidential election. Instead, then prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was the front-running candidate of the ruling SLFP., while former prime minister Ranil Wickramasinghe was the UNP. candidate yet again.

The 2005 presidential election was the closest in Sri Lankan history. Rajapakse won 50.29% of the vote, just 180,786 votes more than Wickramasinghe's 48.43%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lLaMZzBRfy2Rrosu_HP_tQ.png)

## 2010 — The peace dividend

After the Civil War ended in May 2009, President Rajapaksa decided to end his first six-year term nearly two years early, and seek a fresh and broader mandate in a second term. A presidential election was announced for the 26th of January 2010.

General Sarath Fonseka was the opposing candidate, supported by both the UNP and the JVP. Considered a national hero of the Civil War, and commander of the Sri Lank Army from 2005 to 2009, Fonseka had fallen out with Rajapaksa after the end of the conflict.

President Rajapaksa won a second term with 57.88% of the vote, to Fonseka's 40.15%. Rajapaksa won 125 of the 160 polling divisions. Fonseka won just 35; 21 of which were in the Northern and Eastern provinces.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zlSqG8LgVlAyNE_-C0KupQ.png)

## 2015 — The surprise

In April 2010, President Rajapaksa's UPFA alliance won 144 of the 225 seats in the parliamentary election. That September, parliament passed the eighteenth amendment to the constitution, removing the two-term limit on presidents, allowing Rajapaksa to run for a third term.

On the 20th of November 2014, President Rajapaksa sought a presidential election. To the surprise of many, the day after, Maithripala Sirisena, Minister of Health in the Rajapakse cabinet, and general secretary of Rajapakse's own SLFP was revealed as a common opposition presidential candidate, with the support of the UNP, several UPFA members, and President Kumaratunga.

Elections were scheduled for the 8th of January, 2015.

Sirisena won 51.28% of the vote, to Rajapaksa's 47.58%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-NMgECFBVP3Bd_w7FrYuDA.png)

## Common Themes

### Safe Seats

Eight polling divisions have voted for the SLFP, PA or UPFA in all seven presidential elections. They are Baddegama, Habaraduwa, Hakmana, Kamburupitiya, Kesbewa, Attanagalla, Dompe, Gampaha. No polling division has voted for the UNP in all seven presidential elections, though several have in six.

[For simplicity, I've grouped the SLFP, PA and UPFA as "Blue" and the UNP and NDF as "Green".]

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9APQg3oETJpXiO-O2jlH7A.png)

### Recent Safe Seats

If we restrict our analysis to the last four elections (1999–2015), there are many more polling divisions where a single party has won all four elections.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gOaIGdGgrvbcP8_-iTWM1A.png)

### Voting Zones

The "safe seat" maps indicate some patterns in voting:

* There is a rural "heartland" that consistently votes Blue. This includes the Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, the inland of Puttalam, Gampaha and Colombo, Kalutara, the Southern province, the Sabaragamuwa Province, Monaragala, and the inland of Digamadulla (Ampara) and Trincomalee districts.

* The coastal parts of Colombo, Gampaha and Puttalam vote Green

* Much of the central hills usually vote Green

* The north and the east vote Green

## Concluding Warning

A sample of seven is statistically insignificant. It is dangerous to extrapolate predictions based our relatively short presidential electoral history. This warning particularly applies the forthcoming election in November.

Proceed with care. Happy voting!

# Visualizing Election Results

### Different ways to draw maps

Leading up to the 2019 Presidential Election in Sri Lanka, I wanted to learn more about the previous presidential elections. I found this map displaying the results of the 2015 Presidential Election.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lROd_feXFgSV1MS--KTxsQ.png)

For each of Sri Lanka's 160 polling divisions, the colour indicates who won. Pink for President Sirisena. Blue for President Rajapaksa.

As we know, Sirisena won with 51.28%, to Rajapaksa's 47.58%. Seventeen minor candidates shared the remaining 1.14%.

But if you looked at you'd think Rajapaksa won. A larger proportion of the map is blue. Unsurprising, since Rajapaksa won sparsely populated rural polling divisions, and Sirisena won denser urban areas like Colombo.

And this was no exception.

In the 2008 US Presidential Election, President Obama, like Sirisena, he won more urban counties. His opponent, the late Senator McCain, won more rural areas. While Barack Obama won 52.9% of the vote, to McCain's 45.7%, looking at the map of county results, you'd think McCain won. And easily.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k7eJ8SHpjihZXEy7XxefGA.png)

The problem with these maps is that it quantifies geographical space. On the other hand, for an election, quantifying population, or more specifically, the voting population is more important.

Hence, is there a better way of representing election results?

## Solution 1: Continuous Cartograms

>>> "A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable — such as travel time, population, or GNP — is substituted for land area or distance" (Wikipedia).

In the case of elections, we can substitute area for voter population. For example, this is a cartogram of the 2008 US Presidential Election.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sfOkIdtMVvEjyUZ1XPgHWw.png)

These cartograms distort space by population. Densely populated areas push out their boundaries stronger than sparsely populated ones. The end effect is for the former to expand and the latter to shrink.

One problem with this technique is that it distorts and uglifies the map. Here is a population cartogram of Sri Lanka, which has the same uglification problem.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EA3ckneAo1PVYZbV1C49_A.png)

## Solution 2: Non-Continuous Cartograms

An alternative is to resize the areas while preserving shape. For example, the 2008 US Presidential election results alternatively look like this:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UHcy3ZMl2oBN9FCfYfPYLg.gif)

And Sri Lanka, by population, would look like this in a Non-Continuous Cartogram:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d49MKWNKDGZGxtrdC6YULg.png)

Re-proportioning solves the distortion problem. However, it has a deeper problem. When we look at election results, do we care about the shape of Colombo district or the state of Florida? We probably just want to know the outcome. Who won.

## Solution 3: Abstract Cartograms

A more abstract abstraction is to replace area with boxes or other geometric shapes, which are proportional to population.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sMA-rG2QJq4eZvNEV1s7lA.jpeg)

We can also use other shapes. For example, here is a hexagon view of the 2015 and 2017 UK Parliamentary Election results.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*azF-dWuMhFxCizYUwpTgEA.png)

In the next diagram, we go one step further with one box for each of Sri Lanka's 160 polling divisions. The 2015 Presidential Election result looks like this.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WiQRbRXJOLjYx7cdvujFOQ.png)

This view is very specific and focussed. It also connects different districts with similar voting patterns. For example, the east of the Colombo District (Co), unlike the west, tends to vote more like the Kegalle District (Ke).

Note, Presidential Elections in Sri Lanka are won by total votes, but by first-past-the-post, or an electoral college system (as in the US). Hence, specifics of number of votes is also important. If we would factor this, our map would look like:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FWD6K9O4NSMt3fz3tfyyXw.png)

[Comment]Thanks for the feedback!

RE: I wonder whether a map each for each of the two political parties color shaded for percent of votes received by each would give a better representation where PR matters for parliamentary elections.

Yes! It clearly would be a good representation. I've adopted part of this idea in my article on Presidential Elections (https://medium.com/on-politics/a-brief-history-of-sri-lankan-presidential-elections-8782c2dd8aac), where I use shading to represent winning margin in each polling division.

I'm hoping to write a similar article focussed on General Elections, where I can do what you recommend.

# The Feedback Index

### On how to give good feedback

The best people in the best organisations know how to get the best out of the best people. And these best people give the best people the best feedback.

In this article, I defined eight levels of feedback: From the worst feedback (Level 0) to the best feedback (Level 7).

## Level 0: No feedback

>>> I have nothing to say about Higgins.

No feedback is worse than bad feedback. Meaningless feedback is as bad as no feedback.

>>> Higgins is an excellent chap. We get along swimmingly. I look forward to working with Higgins in the future. 😘😘😘

## Level 1: Unsubstantiated opinion

>>> Higgins is a terrible coder.

Opinion is better than no feedback or meaningless feedback. Because it might hint on some area for improvement. It is still poor feedback. It lacks nuance, might be inaccurate, is likely to be misinterpreted, and might be seen as unfair.

## Level 2: Poorly substantiated opinion. Usually with correlated (but not causal) facts

>>> Higgins is a terrible coder. He is always causing the system to crash.

It is unclear why the system crashed, and if Higgins was indeed the cause.

## Level 3: Facts

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code.*

>>> [* See tasks 13234, 13543, 13544 and 14001 for details.]

Now there is a clear causal connection between Higgins and the feedback.

## Level 4: Quantified facts

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code. As a result, we lost $1 million in sales.*

A lot of feedback, while accurate, is not relevant to things the organisation cares about. Quantifying impact aligns the feedback with the organisation's bottom line.

## Level 5: Quantified Facts with recommendations for improvement

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code. As a result, we lost $1 million in sales.

>>> Higgins could avoid such incidents by writing better unit and integration tests, and by testing his code more thoroughly.

The goal of giving feedback is not to give feedback. The goal is to improve the individual individual and the collective organisation. Constructive recommendations enable this.

## Level 6: Quantified Facts with recommendations for improvement, supported by ownership

>>> Last quarter, Higgins caused the system to crash on four different occasions by pushing buggy code. As a result, we lost $1 million in sales.

>>> Higgins could avoid such incidents by writing better unit and integration tests, and by testing his code more thoroughly.

>>> I will work with Higgins to help him improve the quality of his code. I will also monitor the resulting stability of our system.

The best people own the problem. They not only give constructive feedback but volunteer to be responsible for the solution. For these people, nothing is someone else's problem.

### And The Bad Things about Bad Things

Hatred is wishing that something might not exist in the future. And Greed is the opposite. Wishing that something might indeed exist in the future.

Hatred and greed can feed off each other, and themselves. You can hate hate, or be greedy for greed. Or be greedy for hate, or hate greed.

Hatred and Greed lead to many bad things. For example:

Anxiety is the feeling that the future will be bad. It derives from either hatred or greed. Either because something you don't want to exist will exist, or something you want to exist won't.

Regret is the feeling that the past was bad. Like anxiety, it relies on hatred and greed. You can only regret something that didn't happen but you wanted to happen, or something that did happen but you wanted not to happen.

Similarly, you can be anxious about being anxious, or regret regret. You can even be anxious about being anxious about being anxious.

All these bad things have two things in common:

* They involve time (future and past).

* They involve a belief in certainty.

Remove either time or certainty and the bad things vanish.

There is no Satan or Shaitan in Buddhist cosmology. The closest thing we have is the demon Mara. Mara is the embodiment of the belief in time and certainty. A sort of control-freak-par-excellence.

Disappear Mara and badness disappears.

# On Floating Voters

### And Predicting the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

Like many countries, two parties dominate Sri Lankan politics: The UNP (the Greens) and the SLFP (the Blues), or one of their modern incarnations.

And like in many countries, many people always vote for one party, and never for the other. These base voters form each party's "voter base". A chunk of votes that are virtually guaranteed.

The remaining "floating voters" could vote for either party. This latter block usually ends-up deciding the outcome of the election.

In this article, I do an approximate estimation of the base votes for the Blue and Green parties, and the floating vote, and analyse some implications.

## Parenthesis: Some methodological details

An exact measure of the "base vote" would require per-voter data; each ballot would have to be tagged with the voter's ID. Since presidential elections are by secret ballot, we don't have this data. Thus, we have to resort to an approximation (see below for details). This approximation could be an over-estimate (because our estimate might include non-base-voters) or an under-estimate (because some base voters would not have voted in our sample elections).

We've restricted our analysis to the last four elections (1999, 2005, 2010 and 2015). The electorate and political views change over time, and 20 years seemed an arbitrary, but reasonable window.

We classify UNP and NDF candidates as "Green", and PA and UPFA candidates as "Blue".

Collisions and aggrements between the Greens, and Blues, and smaller parties (e.g. TNA, JVP, SLMP) complicate the "base voter" metric. In some cases, the metric might involve some voters from the "base" of these other parties. In these cases, the "base voter" estimate is inflated. The rest of the smaller party voter base is subsumed in the floating vote. [Update addressing concern from Bimal Rathnayake]

For this analysis, we use a Dorling Cartogram. To generate the cartogram, we start with a map of Sri Lanka, we circles for each polling divisions, proportional to the voter population.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Th3WkXPwEVpU_s5aQObsdA.png)

Then, we compress the diagram so that the circles are next to each other.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LY-pyZKeyNoQFnQpuNANvA.png)

## Green Voter Base

For each of Sri Lanka's 160 polling divisions, we estimate a party's "base vote" in that polling division as the lowest proportion of votes they received in the last four elections.

>>> For example, for the Borella polling division, the Greens received 50.1%, 61.8%, 57.5% and 67.0% in the last four elections. Hence, we use 50.1% as an estimate of the voter base for the Greens in Borella.

The five polling divisions with the highest % voter base for the Greens are Paddiruppu (79%), Vavuniya (66%), Colombo West (65%), Trincomalee (64%), and Kilinochchi (63%).

The five polling divisions with the highest Green voter base (in absolute numbers) are Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya (121,737), Batticaloa (71,611), Colombo Central (60,279), Harispattuwa (57,763), and Kaduwela (50,370), extrapolating to the 2015 voter population.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IfNjFnxUwhaq6vKN3lw5Bw.png)

In total, the Greens voter base is about 39% country-wide.

## Blue Voter Base

Similarly, the five polling divisions with the highest % voter base for the Blues are Dompe (58%), Kamburupitiya (57%), Habaraduwa (57%), Baddegama (56%), and Medawachchiya (56%).

The five polling divisions with the highest Blue voter base (in absolute numbers) are Homagama (76,986), Kesbewa (73,819), Kaduwela (70,573), Ampara (64,240) and Mahara (63,922).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*77DAgOhBMt2BRkaOWVB2Og.png)

In total, the Blues voter base is about 44% country-wide.

## Blue vs Green

This diagram depicts the difference between blue and green base voter populations.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-_381kJsJ9y7M09MYOrSjw.png)

## The Floating Vote

With the Blue and Green voter bases at 44% and 39%, the remaining 17% is the floating vote.

The five polling divisions with the highest % floating vote are Sammanthurai (52.2%), Kankesanthurai (51.3%), Mullaitivu (49.4%), Manipay (49.3%), and Kalmunai (47.9%).

The five polling divisions with the highest floating vote (in absolute numbers) are Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya (67,806), Pottuvil (38,653), Polonnaruwa (31,349), Sammanthurai (28,508), and Mutur (27,935).

[Polonnaruwa might be an anomaly, with many Blue voters defecting to Green, in the 2015 election]

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CJ9hfgXupKFgxJuJsDAjBA.png)

While the largest densities of floating voters are in the Northern and Eastern provinces, they are spread across the whole country. In aggregate, about 3% of the 17% floating vote is in the Northern and Eastern provinces, 3% in the Central and Uva province, 4% in the Western province, and 7% across the rest of the country.

## Winning Elections

Any Blue candidate wishing to win a Presidential Election will need at least 6% of the floating vote, while a Green candidate would need at least 11%.

In the past four Presidential Elections, this is how the Blue and Green parties performed among floating voters.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bKNLTBQqP50h6vXDMA5Anw.png)

### 2015

In 2015, the Greens won 51.28% of the vote, to the Blues' 47.58%. More importantly, they also won 13% of the 17% floating vote, to the Blues 3%, dominating the floating vote across the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ortkEHiIZiahBBO3WEV4lQ.png)

### 2005

Given their relatively smaller voter base, winning the floating vote is not sufficient for the greens to win the election.

For example, the 2005 presidential election was the closest in Sri Lankan history. The Blues won 50.29% of the vote, just 180,786 votes more than the Greens' 48.43%.

While the Greens dominated the floating vote (10% to the Blues' 6%), it wasn't enough to win the election.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bTiw10m7JaFB53yUTXWSWg.png)

### 2019 Predictions

This data provides no strong prediction on who is going to win in 2019. All we can say is that the blues will (probably) win at least 44% of the vote, while the Greens will win at least 39% of the vote.

Either side has some chance of winning.

# Why we are bored

### And three paradoxes that cause boredom

Boredom is a lack of interest in our present situation. Nothing seems to be "interesting". We tend to think "Nothing is interesting" and "I am bored". Optionally, we might also be thinking "I wish I were somewhere else, doing something else".

Hence, three conditions are necessary for boredom.

* A present situation that is not interesting

* Thinking about the "not interesting"-ness

* (Optionally) A future condition that is more interesting

## The Problem

### Paradox 1: A present situation that is not interesting

How do we come to realize that the present situation is not interesting?

Suppose we are at a conference. The speaker is rambling. The content is not particularly interesting. We look around and notice people are falling asleep. Hence, after collecting this data, we reason that the speaker is boring. And we are in a boring situation. Thus, it is justifiable to feel bored. So we feel bored.

Usually, something completely different happens. Our subconscious mind decides (without reason) that our present situation is boring. We look around to find evidence to support our hypothesis.

>>> We notice that, while many people look interested, some people are falling asleep. While parts of the speech are original and imaginative, other parts we already know. While the speaker has some speaking skills, he is no Martin Luther King.

Hence, we find plenty of evidence to support our "boredom" hypothesis. After analysing all this data, our conscious minds reason that we "should be bored".

We think that external observations cause our internal conclusion. In fact, our internal conclusion causes our external observations. What seems "rational" is post-rationalization. Hence, our present situation does not cause our boredom. Our boredom causes our boring present situation.

### Paradox 2: Thinking about the "not interesting"-ness

Thought is a survival tool. When we are in life-threatening situations (like seeing something that looks like a snake), we think ourselves to safety.

But most of the time, thinking is useless noise. Like many birds have a natural pecking reflex, humans have a natural thinking reflex. We love to think about anything and everything. Usually coming to ridiculous conclusions.

Too often roles reverse. And we become a tool of our thought. As opposed to thought being a survival tool for us, we become a survival tool for thought.

Everything we think is food for thought. We think our actual boredom causes our thinking about boredom. In reality, our thinking causes our boredom.

### Paradox 3: A future situation that is more interesting

Often boredom is a function of some future event. If you have an interesting event planned for the evening, the whole day feels dull, and you can't wait for time to pass.

But here too something like Paradox 1 is at play. If you decide Event A is more interesting than Event B, it is trivial to find evidence to justify your decision. When dealing with complex entities (like events, or conference speakers), anything can be shown to be better or worse than anything else.

Hence, again we might think that our present situation is less interesting than a future situation and that we are justified in feeling bored. The reality is that our boredom is causing us to see the future as more interesting than the present.

## The Solution

### Cure 1: Reverse Post-Rationalisation

"A present situation that is not interesting" and "A future situation that is more interesting" are both post-rationalizations that follow a decision that we are already bored. Hence, concluding that "we are not bored" will result in the opposite post-rationalizations.

For example, consider our conference speaker.

>>> We notice that, while some people are falling asleep, many people look interested. While we already know parts of the speech, other parts are novel and imaginative. While the speaker is no Martin Luther King, he has some speaking skills.

Hence, we conclude that the speech is interesting.

### Cure 2: Beyond Thinking

The problem with Cure 1 is that it is still post-rationalization. We exchange one illusion for another. The bigger villain is thinking itself. The slave that has enslaved its master.

They say, "One is never bored when one is drunk". And this is very true. Alcohol is one of the most potent cures for boredom, because it deadens the frontal cortex, stifling thought. This is why "dry" parties bore alcoholics. It is not that "sweet" parties involve a lot of interesting goings on. It is that they don't involve thinking.

Sleep is another easy way "not to think". Thus, it is natural to feel drowsy and fall asleep when we are bored.

But there is an even better cure for thinking (and, hence, boredom): meditation. All forms of meditation begin with "being" without "thinking". Some even transcend "being". It is a way of experiencing reality without "thinking" whether it is interesting or not. Hence, it is a form of being interested, that is beyond thinking interested or not thinking interested.

A straightforward way to bring the slave (thinking) in line, is to observe it. If we watch out for the thought "I am bored", we should observe that "I am thinking, ‘I am bored'". The moment the slave is in the light, it gives up any pretence or aspiration of being the master.

Are you thinking, "I am bored"?

# Capitalism vs Socialism

### The False Debate

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tai_EzqX2CzeWiXvN4DzmA.jpeg)

## The Problem with Friends

Am I a socialist or a capitalist?

My socialist friends call me a capitalist. My capitalist friends call me a socialist. Sadly, I am neither.

Not only do I detest being labelled as one or the other, I believe the Capitalism vs Socialism debate is at best a waste of time. At worst, it is an effort to misguide and distract from more important issues.

Why? Let me explain.

## Autocracy to Democracy

In a capitalist system, ownership of capital is in private or individual hands. As a result of this private ownership, economic, political and social power in a capitalist system is proportional to the amount of the said private capital owned. Rich people have more power; poor people have less power. On one hand, the distribution of power could be extreme, resulting in autocracy. In many capitalistic autocracies, the institutions are the slaves of the rich. They are also known as plutocracies. They merely enable and enforce the interests of the current owners of capital. On the other hand, the distribution of power could be equitable, resulting in democracy.

In a socialist system, economic, political and social power is in the hands of a state, which itself is a collective. The state is a collection of individuals. And the distribution of power between these individuals could be as varied as in a capitalist system. Hence, a socialist system could also be anything from autocracy to democracy.

## Free Markets and Competition

Capitalists claim that capitalism promotes free markets and competition. Leading to more better production. But many capitalists systems turn into anti-competitive monopolies. The only way to solve this problem is socialist regulation by a state that is more powerful than the private individuals that run the said monopolies.

Similarly, socialists claim that they can come up with longer-term more enlightened goals, that benefit more people. But too often the best way to achieve such goals is through private individuals doing whatever that is most beneficial to them.

## Good things and bad things

A society where all individuals are happy and prosperous is a good thing. And there seem to be other good things that enables higher-good things like happiness and prosperity. Good things like equity, free markets, and strong institutions.

Capitalism and socialism are not, in themselves, good things or bad things. It depends on how they enable actual good things like equity, strong institutions and free markets. Which lead to higher good things like happiness and prosperity.

It seems that neither Capitalism or Socialism is sufficient to achieve these good things. A capitalist system with no equity is just as dysfunctional as a socialist system with no free markets. And so is either with biased institutions.

Hence, we should dump this futile Capitalism vs Socialism debate. And instead shift to more important things like conversations and action about Equity, Free Markets, and Strong Institutions. A nation with more equity, freer markets, and stronger Institutions is better than one which is merely capitalists or socialist.

# Faith, Hope, Love

### On Metta, Karuna, Mudita, and Upekkha

I first saw it in 2007. Over 109 years after its completion.

It is best seen in the moonlight. Like many sandstone buildings. With its carved flowers, sculptured angels, and curving three of life. The shortage of tourists at night means that one can also enjoy in peace. Instead of being poked in the eye. With a selfie stick.

Mosaics of love, faith, hope, and charity adorn the facade of the Stanford Memorial Church.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YZ6uyNZSpll7ZXCsaUUKNg.jpeg)

## Paul

In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul says:

>>> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal resounding in the wind. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and can understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have faith, that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I give all I possess to the poor, and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.

>>> Love is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

>>> Love has no fear; it does not worry; love keeps no records of wrongs; never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.

>>> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

>>> And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VvzhOC58rbuFbAfsQvExTA.png)

## Love in the time of uncertaintly

Much literature and theology refer to love, faith and hope. But few attempt to define them. That is left to philosophers.

Reflecting, I noticed an uncanny resemblance between these terms, and what I wrote in Love in the time of uncertainty.

### Love: Your bad time is my bad time. Your good time is my good time

>>> Since bad times are a result of uncertainty, the cause of your bad times is the same as the cause of my bad times.

>>> If some bad time befell you, it is only a matter of time before something similar happens to me. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat your bad time as your problem, and not my problem.

The rationale is the same for good time.

### Faith: In good times and bad

>>> If everything is uncertain, then there is no difference between good times and bad times. Random uncertainty causes both. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat you one way or another way all because times are good, or times are bad.

### Hope: May you and I have good times

>>> If everything is uncertain, there is no point pretending that the future will be good or bad. But why not hope for the best? And not just for me, but equally for you also?

And similarly, the resemblance to the four Brahmaviharas is also unmistakable: Hope is Metta. Love is Karuna and Mudita. Faith is Upekkha

# Why Random Numbers might not be Random Numbers

### On Patterns and Randomness

Do you remember the last time you got an SMS with a two-factor-authentication code from Gmail, or Facebook, or your bank?

Do you remember looking at the four or six digits thinking,

>>> "Isn't this supposed to be a random code? It doesn't look very random to me".

It happens to me all the time.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AYNpaAfzYNx5pSbYhsjfhg.png)

## Applying the "scientific" method

So, I thought of investigating. By generating ten four-digit random codes, and checking if they were indeed "random".

* 4274: "42" is a multiple of "7". Can't be random!

* 7608: This number has "6", "7" and "8". Can't be random!

* 2523: "23" followed by the next odd number "25". Can't be random!

* 1983: My cousin's wife's husband's grand-uncle's year of birth! Can't be random!

* 5555: Four "5"s in a row. What are the chances of that happening? Can't be random!

* 2974: "9" — "7" = "2". Can't be random!

* 4664: A palindrome! Can't be random!

* 8485: Consecutive numbers! Can't be random!

* 6656: Three "6"s. And "5". Can't be random!

* 1994: The year CBK became president! Can't be random.

Conclusion? No four-digit-code is random! We are certainly doomed! The apocalypse is nigh!

## Not quite

What does it mean for some pattern to be "random"? It means that the chance of getting the said pattern is highly unlikely.

But how unlikely are the patterns we observed?

* 4274: The chance of one two digit number being a multiple of one digit number is about 83%.

* 7608: The chance of getting three digits that are consecutive is about 14%.

* 1983: The chance of getting a 20th century birth year is about 1 in 90

* 5555: The chance of getting 4 consecutive numbers is 1 in 1000

And so on.

While some patterns are unlikely, others are quite likely. For example, with ten codes, your almost never likely not to get a "one two digit number being a multiple of one digit number" like 4274. The chance of not getting such a number is about 1 in 50,000,000.

Even with unlikely patterns like "5555", with so many codes, they are bound to turn up at some point. For example, if you have received a 100 codes, there is about a 10% chance, that you've received a code where all the numbers are the same.

The problem is not that random numbers are not random. But because we humans are over-sensitive to patterns.

So, all's well!

Please continue to use two-factor-authentication!

# Beyond Greens and Blues

### TODOs for third parties

Imagine you support a third-party candidate in the upcoming 2019 Sri Lankan presidential elections. Now, imagine you read my article On Floating Voters, where I say:

>>> "With the Blue and Green voter bases at 44% and 39%, the remaining 17% is the floating vote."

And conclude:

>>> "All we can say is that the blues will (probably) win at least 44% of the vote, while the Greens will win at least 39% of the vote."

What should you do? Give-up in despair? Emigrate to some lonely western country? Or curl up into a ball like Prince Dutugemunu? If the Greens and the Blues will get 39% + 44% of the vote, how can a third party possibly win?

Actually, giving-up might be premature. In this article, I try and explain why.

## 1. Prove the statistics wrong

Statistics rely on many assumptions. One crucial assumption is that "the future will be like the past". While this assumption is reasonable, from time to time, there are "Black Swans": A future event that is nothing like any past event.

Historically, two parties have dominated French Politics: The Center-Left Socialist Party, and the Gaullist, Center-Right Union for the New Republic, or one of its incarnations. In 2017, Emmanuel Macron won the French Presidency, with a completely new party La République En Marche, beating candidates from both left and right. Not only did Macron win the presidency, En Marche went on to win the French Parliament soon after, in a General Election.

Macron was a Black Swan. And Black Swans prove statistics "wrong" all the time. I use inverted commas because it is not precisely statistics that is wrong, but the "the future will be like the past" assumption.

"Green or Blues will always win because the future will be like the past" is also an assumption. An assumption that any third party worth its salt should try and prove wrong in the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jsrXbZMsNs7uD2TkxxaL5A.png)

## 2. Break the base

A candidate needs 50% plus one vote to win a presidential election. With a floating vote of only 17%, to win, a third party would have to "break into" a significant part of voter bases of the Greens and the Blues.

But wait! Isn't it impossible to break into the base vote? Don't people in the base, by definition, not vote for other parties?

Not quite.

The concept of a "base vote" is approximate and relative. Even the most stubborn voters change their mind. And also if they don't, all voters eventually, die. So the "voting base" of any party is continuously changing — slowly but still changing.

However, to break the base, a third candidate would need to do something truly extraordinary; something that will energise, inspire and rally the electorate. Sadly, thus far, I haven't seen anything like that. But that doesn't mean it won't happen before November 16th.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*thHNwPpA4VL7JGNwG1J0nw.png)

## 3. Make a start

I don't realistically believe that a third party candidate could win this presidential election. However, I do believe that this presidential election could be the first step of something much bigger for a third party.

For example, let's suppose a third party wins 15% of the vote. Let's say by winning most of the floating vote, and some non-trivial proportion of the voter bases of the main parties. Now, this would be a massive achievement for the said third party, and no easy feat.

But that won't be the end.

In Sri Lanka, Presidential Elections and General (Parliamentary) elections go hand in glove. A good performance in one implies a good performance in the other. Whichever party that wins next monthhas a good chance of winning the next General election. And our next General Election must happen before December 2020.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_lWkOFXUJlmgFV0DsqZthA.png)

If our hypothetical third-party replicates their 15% share in a general election, they should get over 30 seats. Any party with 30 seats has a significant influence in parliament. It could be the start of something substantial and meaningful.

The odds are steep, but not impossible.

## Epilogue — Respect to the undecided

I haven't decided how to vote. Like many people in the country, I might end up voting for the Green or Blue candidate. Or I might vote for a third party. Either way, as of writing, I am undecided.

To "decide" we have to think. While we are "undecided", we are thinking. And once we "decide" we stop thinking.

If my piece On Floating Voters said one thing, it is that about 44% + 39% of Sri Lankan Voters had already decided. Many of them probably had their genes, circumstances, ethnicity or religion decide on their behalf. And after that, they stopped thinking. Many of them decided before they were born. Many of them, before they reached voting age.

Maybe its time to undecide. And start thinking again.

# Bellwether Polling Divisions

>>> Predicting the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

The term bellewether referred to the ancient English practice of placing a metallic bell around the neck of a castrated ram (known as a wether) that led a flock of sheep. A shepherd could identify the flock movements by the tinkling of the bell. Even when the flock out of sight.

In modern usage, the term bellwether refers to an entity or individual that indicates trends in a larger system or collective.

For example, whichever candidate won the state of Ohio has won the presidency in all but two of 58 US Presidential Elections. Hence, states like Ohio, Florida (also two misses), Nevada, Missouri, New Mexico, and Tennessee (all with three misses) are known as "Bellwether states".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KaceZ69RE1dNi1YTipBMgw.gif)

I was curious if Sri Lanka's Presidential Election had any Bellwether trends. For example, were there any polling divisions which always backed the winning candidate?

## Perfect Bellwethers

Sri Lanka did indeed have eight bellwether polling divisions: Moratuwa and Ratmalana (Colombo Electoral District), Ja-Ela and Katana (Gampaha Electoral District), Mawathagama (Kurunegala Electoral District), Medirigiriya, Minneriya and Polonnaruwa (Polonnaruwa Electoral District). Whichever candidate won these polling divisions, went on to win the presidency.

For example, these are the results for Moratuwa.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p52QDxsZ23eRq6vpnZx5CA.png)

I could see no discernible pattern in the distribution of bellwether polling divisions across the country:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PrkfkPSgRXqpNtR6eJ5plw.png)

## Percentage Bellwethers

We defined a perfect bellwether as a polling division which was always won by the winning candidate.What about the percentage of votes? Are there bellwethers that also match the winning percentage?

For each of the 160 polling divisions in Sri Lanka, I looked at the absolute error between the percentage of votes a winning candidate won island-wide, and the percentage of votes that winning candidate won in the polling division.

The polling division with the lowest error was Moratuwa. The percentage of votes a winning candidate received island-wide differed by an average of 1.2% in Moratuwa.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3m_f5znhM6Qp7PXHBPsKXA.png)

Interestingly, the polling division with the second-lowest error (1.6%), Yatinuwara, in the Kandy Electoral District, is not a Perfect Bellwether, backing the losing candidate in 1988. However, its percentages have matched the island-wide result almost precisely in the last two presidential elections.

The top percentage bellwethers are as follows:

## Bellwether Electoral Districts

We defined and analyzed "bellwether-ness" at a polling division level. What about at the electoral district level? Have any of the 22 electoral district consistently managed to pick the winner?

Observent readers would have noticed that all three polling divisions in the Polonnaruwa electoral district were bellwethers. Hence, the Polonnaruwa electoral district as a whole is itself a bellwether.

No other electoral district has backed the winner in all seven presidential elections, though Colombo, Gampaha, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Kandy, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Monaragala and Hambantota have backed six.

Interestingly, the best percentage bellwether electoral district (i.e. that which matches the winning presidential candidate's islandwide percentage vote best) is not Polonnaruwa, but Puttalam. In fact, Polonnaruwa is only ninth best.

## Bellwether Fallacies

### "Perfect Bellwethers will always be Perfect Bellwethers."

Suppose you are watching the results as they come in, after the November 16th election. Let's suppose you notice that candidate Sajith Premadasa (say) wins the Moratuwa polling division.

Can you conclude that the UNP candidate has won the election?

You cannot. The "perfectness" of a bellwether polling division is how well it matches the results of the country as a whole. Bellwether polling divisions support political parties in the same proportions that the country as a whole supports these parties. This support can change, and the polling division could diverge from the country.

In the very first presidential election (1982), the UNP candidate J. R. Jayawardena won 137 out of 160 polling divisions. Hence, after this first election, 137 polling divisions were (trivially) "perfect' bellwethers. Given the UNPs big victory, many electorates that might have voted for its opponents, ended-up voting for the UNP. Hence, the high number of bellwether polling divisions. Also, with a single election, we have only one sample. Thus, the statistical significance of our bellwether statistic is low.

In subsequent elections, the Bellwether count drops, while the significance of the metric increases:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CFiZ1xeg58Czeu0DxdAzZw.png)

On the eve of the 2015 election, there were 44 perfect bellwether polling divisions. Avissawella was one such polling divisions that had backed the winner in all six presidential elections.

Suppose you were watching the results as they come in, after the 2015 election. Let's suppose you noticed that candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa won the Avissawella polling division.

Could you conclude that the UPFA candidate had won the election? Not quite.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3wymm1VSRZjENPCUodLZ5w.png)

In 2015, Avissawella backed the losing candidate, lost its bellwether status, and Maitripala Sirisena ended-up winning the election.

### "Candidates should try to win all the Perfect Bellwethers."

Bellwethers are bellwethers because they correlate strongly with the voting behaviour of the country as a whole. However, there is no causal relationship between the result of the bellwether and that of the country.

Thus, trying to win a bellwether (for example, by campaigning more in such polling divisions), would not lead to more votes in the country as a whole. The candidate might win the bellwether, and lose the country, leading to the polling division losing its bellwether status (as Avissawella did).

On the other hand, bellwethers might be good places to learn about voter preferences and needs. They could act as "samples" for the country as a whole. But after such insights are gained, they must be applied to the whole country. Not just to the bellwether.

### "Polonnaruwa is special."

As we learnt, not only is the Polonnaruwa electoral district a bellwether, so are all three of its polling divisions. So is there something special about the ancient, former-capital of Sri Lanka? When it comes to presidential elections?

Probably not. And here's why. We can divide our "history of presidential elections" into three groups:

* 1982 and 1988: The Green Era. In this Era, much of the Sinhala majority heartland supported the UNP. Including Polonnaruwa. So it's not surprising that Polonnaruwa voted for the UNP.

* 1994, 1999, 2005, 2010: The Blue Era. Following Chandrika Kumaratunga's 1994 victories in both general and presidential elections, the heartland turned Blue. Again, it's not surprising that Polonnaruwa voted for the Blue Party.

* 2015: The Polonnaruwa Era. In 2015, much of the Sinhala heartland remained Blue, voting for Mahinda Rajapaksa. One exception was Polonnaruwa, which supported their very own Maitripala Sirisena, who went on to win the election.

Hence, it is not surprising that Polonnaruwa supported the winning candidate in every election.

## So who is going to win?

As usual, I'm going to utter my favourite phrase: "I don't know".

I also don't know what the voters in our current perfect bellwethers (i.e. Moratuwa, Ratmalana, Ja-Ela, Katana, Mawathagama, Medirigiriya, Minneriya and Polonnaruwa) are thinking. But maybe you do.

If you go to Ratmalana, talk to a bunch of Ratmalaneans and find out that they are all supporting candidate X, you could make one of three conclusions:

* Either candidate X will win, and Ratmalana will remain a Perfect Bellwether.

* Or else candidate X will not win, and Ratmalana will loose its Perfect Bellwether status.

* Or else, you didn't walk to enough Ratmalaneans.

It's that simple.

Happy voting!

# Election Projections

### Predicting the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

After polling stations close at 5pm on Saturday, November 16th, the arduous process of vote counting begins. With a record number of candidates, counting might take even longer than usual. It might be as late as Monday (November 18th) when the first results are announced.

The results of smaller polling divisions and postal votes are usually released first. Followed by larger polling divisions. The "size" of the polling division is not the only factor that determines release time. Many polling booths, particularly in remote mountainous parts of the country, are many hours away from counting stations. Hence, travel time also influences how soon results are released.

Either way, some results are announced before others.

The question I want to investigate in this article is:

>>> Can we use early results to project and predict the final result? And if so, how accurate would such a projection be?

## The Experiment

To find out, I ran the following experiment with the previous (2015) presidential election:

* I assumed that election results were reported in order of result size. Starting with smaller results like postal votes. Ending with larger polling divisions like Homagama, Kaduwela, and Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya.

* For each set of reported results, I built a linear regression model that predicted the final result based on these reported results. The model was trained on the results of the previous six presidential elections.

* To validate if my predictions were reasonable, I also computed "error bounds" of the statistics.

For my experiment, I ignored the travel time factor, and assumed that "time to report" is proportional to the "number of votes to count". It is probably possible to to get the exact "release time" from the Election Commission, or by tracking how media organizations reported the results in 2015, but this seemed too much work. "Number of votes to count" felt good enough.

## 2015 Results

The smallest results for 2015 were the Vanni, Batticaloa and Puttalam district postal votes. Followed by Nuwara Eliya, Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee district postal votes.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E4RACDKrLneVXZG8TLyRZg.png)

Kayts was next, the smallest polling division, by total polled.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p0oRMElutyOgR6ivYx6_1A.png)

After each result, I computed the expected final votes for the two major candidates: Mahinda Rajapaksa (UPFA — Blue) and Maitripala Sirisena (NDF — Red).

Plotting the predictions, I got the following graph.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u6f__dSHBVAHEc2jA41XHw.png)

The thick blue line indicates the projected vote proportion for the UPFA. The two thin blue lines either side, indicate the upper and lower error bounds. Similarly, the red lines correspond to the NDF.

While there is a lot of noise early, indicating the model is weak, and data from previous elections is not representative for small numbers of reported results, it quickly settles down. The obvious observation is that the election is very close. For most of the graph, the blue lines and red lines overlap, indicating that the election is "too close to call".

To see this better, let's zoom in:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pPskeaWDNKMnLRqyuhh-aQ.png)

While the blue leads red in some places, and red leads blue in other places, the lower error bar for red (almost) never exceeds the upper error bar for blue, and vice versa. In other words, the best case for blue is never worse than the worse case for green, and vice versa. In other words: Too close to call.

There are some intriguing individual results.

At Hanguranketha, the projection shifts in favour of the blues. The blues do better than expected in a polling division that has favoured the reds (and greens) in the past. Note, the result was still statistically insignificant.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KRMShrP-oBaddHXk5zeDqw.png)

The opposite happens with Colombo North.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2X-ONJQxpB6eAE-KppiFXA.png)

The final results were:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lzp3-azn3E9MxN4UJyGWAw.png)

You can watch a video with a complete roll of "Realtime Results and Projections" here:

## 2010 Results

The 2010 Sri Lankan Presidential Election was a one-sided affair, where the UPFA candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa, comprehensively beat the NDF candidate Sarath Fonseka. So comprehensively that our projection picked the winner after about 30 results.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cMTVsbRKLiItmpFZi3ow0Q.png)

Note that after about 30 results, the best case for red is worse than the worst-case for blue. Hence, the projection (indicating that blue would win) is statistically significant.

## 2005 Results

The 2005 presidential election was the closest in Sri Lankan history. The UPFA's Mahinda Rajapakse won 50.29% of the vote, just 180,786 votes more than the UNP's Ranil Wickramasinghe's 48.43%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9WN_BA0fBT0IMv4aBnkapw.png)

While the projection for the UPFA led that for the UNP for most of the graph (consistent with the final result), the difference was never statistically significant. Hence, again, "too close to call", throughout.

## Concluding thoughts

In On Floating Voters and Bellwether Polling Divisions, I demonstrated the difficulties in predicting election results before elections. In this article, I went even further and demonstrated how difficult predictions are, even after some results are announced.

And this time around (2019), accurate predictions and projections are likely to be even more difficult, particular with several third parties vying for the spotlight, and a record number of candidates overall. We also have a substantial number of first-time voters, who might diverge from the past in their voting preferences.

Either way, come November 16th, 17th, 18th and possibly 19th, statistics might be scratching its poor head. With a confused look on its face.

# On Dualism

### And air-conditioning

Our meeting room was too cold. Someone said. And we all agreed. It was cold. Very cold. We should do something about the coldness.

And someone did do something. Someone switched off the air-conditioning.

And all was well.

But all was not well. Something was wrong.

We had all agreed that the room was cold. We had judged that part of the universe (our meeting room) as a cold place. But is there some universally accepted convention for judging a place as cold? Something like "If it is less than 25 degrees, it must be cold?"

We had all accepted some such convention. But there was nothing to say that that there was anything right about that convention.

On the one hand, our behaviour was completely normal. Fear of cold is a very natural instinct. Countless humans would have died of cold. And countless others would have saved themselves from dying, by feeling the cold and taking remedial action (like switching off air-cons).

But on the other hand, it didn't feel right. Making-up an arbitrary convention.

After all, don't such conventions lead to most problems in the word?

For example,

* If you arbitrarily judge the future to be a bad place, you feel anxiety.

* Judge the future to be a good place, you feel hope.

* Judge the past to be a bad place, you feel guilt.

* Judge the past to be a good place, you feel pride.

* Judge that something should exist in your future, you feel greed.

* Judge that something should not exist in your future, you feel hatred.

All these our conventions. Resulting from our dualistic view of the world.

The solution to these problems of dualism is not switching poles. Because if you switch poles, you still end up with a pole. Another pole. But a pole, none-the-less.

Hence,

* If you reverse anxiety, you end up with hope.

* Reverse guilt and you end up with pride

* Reverse greed and you end up with hatred.

* Reverse hatred and you end up with greed.

The problem is not anxiety, hope, guilt, pride, hatred or greed. But dualism itself.

Give up dualism, and all problems vanish.

# Why women should rule the world

### And why nature's male experiment has failed

In the beginning, there were only women. Or to be precise, the earth was only populated by female organisms. They didn't actually call themselves female. Because 1) English wasn't invented, and 2) males weren't invented either, hence there was no need to differentiate between sexes. Because there was only one sex: And that sex was female.

Then about a billion years ago, some female eukaryotes mutated into males. And so began the now-famous entertainment of sexual reproduction. While before each female was perfectly happy to create a copy of herself, now she had to find a "man", and go through the time consuming and emotionally problematic process of mating.

There are many theories as to why males "happened". Scientists also agree that sexual species (i.e. ones with males and females) had some evolutionary advantage over asexual ones (i.e. ones with only females). Hence, in this sense, sexual species were "better" than asexual ones, and males seemed to have brought some benefit.

But there is a more important question.

Is our world with sexual species "better" than a parallel counter-factual universe where males never evolved? What if the evolution of males was net negative? While it might be true that sexual species are relatively more successful than asexual ones, what if everyone ended-up worse of in an absolute sense?

Since we have no way of knowing what that parallel word looked like, we can only conjecture. But I speculate that the male experiment has failed.

Why? Just look around you.

All the world's conflicts stem from men that feel inadequate. At the root of any war is one man or a small number of men. Little men who want to show that they are big men.

For every good idea in the world, there are a thousand crazy ideas. And the most dangerous crazy ideas have been dreamt up by men. From the tops of mountains, or man-caves, or prison cells. Men who in turn, inspire millions of other men to dream crazy. You would never find a woman at the heart of a fundamentalist cult.

In a crazy world led by the likes of Trump, BoJo and Putin, voices of sense and reason are few and rarely heard. When they are heard, they come from the likes of Merkel, Ardern, and QE II. All women.

Hence, there is plenty of evidence that the effect of men on the world is indeed net negative.

It's probably time for us to accept that the male experiment has failed. And it's time for the world to return to its natural order. An order ruled by women.

# Command Line Analytics

### Analysing Election Results like a boss

Recently, I've written a couple of articles analysing Sri Lankan Presidential Elections, including: Election Projections, Bellwether Polling Divisions, On Floating Voters and A Brief History of Sri Lankan Presidential Elections.

All these analyses are based on data I scraped from the Election Commission Website. I have shared this data in JSON and CSV format on GitHub.

In this article, I share a couple simple commands you can use to answer some interesting questions about elections.

I use data from presidential_election_results.denorm.csv, which is a table of all the results in our seven Presidential Elections.

# බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ

### 2019 ශ්‍රී ලංකා ජනාධිපතිවරණ අනාවැකි

ඉංග්‍රීසී බසින් "බෙල්" (bell — නූතන ඉංග්‍රීසී, belle — පුරාණ ඉංග්‍රීසී) යනු "සිනුව" යන්නයි. "වෙදර්" (wether) යනු " බැටළුවා" යන්නයි. පුරාණ ඉංග්‍රීසී බසින් "බෙල්වෙදර" (bellewether — පුරාණ ඉංග්‍රීසී) යෙදුම, ගෙල වටා සීනුවක් බැඳගත් වාත්තු බැටළුවකු හැදින්වීමට භාවිතා විය. සීනු ශබ්දය මගින් එඬරුවාට පට්ටියක නිශ්චිත ස්ථානය දැනගැනීමට හැකි විය.

නූතන භාවිතයේ "බෙල්වෙදර්" (bellwether-නූතන ඉංග්‍රීසී) යෙදුම අනාගත ප්‍රවණතා අනාවරණය කරන යමෙකු හෝ යමක් හැඳින්වීමට භාවිතා වේ.

උදාහරණයක් වශයෙන්, එක්සත් ජනපදයේ ජනාධිපතිවරණ 58ක් පවත්වා ඇත. 58න් දෙකක හැර අන් සියලු ජනාධිපතිවරණයකම ඔහායෝ (Ohio) ප්‍රාන්තය ජයග්‍රහණය කළ අපේක්ෂකයා, ජනාධිපති ධුරයද ජයගත්තේය. එබැවින් ඔහියෝ, ෆ්ලොරිඩා (Florida), නෙවාඩා (Nevada), මිසූරි (Missouri), නව මෙක්සිකෝව (New Mexico) සහ ටෙනසි (Tennessee) වැනි ප්‍රාන්ත "බෙල්වෙදර් ජනපද" (bellwether states) ලෙස හැඳින්වේ.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ජනාධිපතිවරණ වලද බෙල්වෙදර් ප්‍රවණතා තිබේද? යම් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයක් ජයගන්නා අපේක්ෂකයා සැමවිටම මුළු ජනධිපතිවරණයද ජයගන්නා ප්‍රවනතාවයක් පවතීද? එවන් විශේෂ ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ මොනවාද?

මේ ලිපියෙන් මේ ප්‍රශ්නවලට පිළිතුරු දීමට මම උත්සාහ කරමි.

## පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර්

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ජනාධිපතිවරණ හතක් පවත්වා ඇත. සියලු ජනාධිපතිවරණකම මොරටුව, රත්මලාන, ජා-ඇල, කටාන, මාවතගම, පොලොන්නරුව, මින්නේරිය හෝ මැදිරිගිරිය ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ ජයග්‍රහණය කළ අපේක්ෂකයා, ජනාධිපති ධුරයද ජයගත්තේය.

එබැවින්මේ, ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ අට "පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ" ලෙස හැඳින්විය හැක.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TRCcwg4rfNG9WqzlYCPdfg.png)

දිවයින පුරා, පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ ව්‍යාප්තියේ පැහැදිලි රටාවක් නැත:

## ප්‍රතිශත බෙල්වෙදර්

"පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ" අර්ථ දැක්වීමේදී, අපි යම් අපේක්ෂකයෙක් යම් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයක් ජයග්‍රහණය කිරීම හෝ නොකිරීම සැලකුවෙමු. අවසාන ප්‍රතිඵලයේ ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශතවලට සමාන ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශත ඇති ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ තිබේද?

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ 160 සඳහාම, ජනාධිපතිවරණ ජයග්‍රහණය කළ අපේක්ෂකයා, එම ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයේ ලබාගත් ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශතය සහ රටපුරා ලබාගත් මුළු ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශතය සසඳා බැලුවෙමි. එම ප්‍රතිශත දෙක අතර සංඛ්යානමය වෙනසද විමර්ශනය කළෙමි.

අඩුම සංඛ්යානමය වෙනස ඇති ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශක් වූයේ මොරටුවය. ජයග්‍රාහී අපේක්ෂකයා දිවයින පුරා ලබාගත් ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශතය මොරටුවෙහි ලබාගත් ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශතයෙන් සාමාන්‍යයෙන් 1.2%ක පමණින් වෙනස් විය.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TRCcwg4rfNG9WqzlYCPdfg.png)

මොරටුවට පසු අඩුම ප්‍රතිශත වෙනස තිබුනේ පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයක් නොවන යටිනුවර ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයටය. 1988 සහ 2005 ජනාධිපතිවරණ ජයගත් ජනාධිපතිවරණ යටිනුවර පරාජය වුවත්, 2010 සහ 2015 ජනාධිපතිවරණ වල ජයග්‍රාහී අපේක්ෂකයා යටිනුවර ලබාගත් ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශත, දිවයින පුරා ලබාගත් ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශත වලට‍ ඉතා සමානයවේ.

## බෙල්වෙදර් මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්ක

අපි ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ මට්ටමින් "බෙල්වෙදර්" විශ්ලේෂණය කළෙමු. මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික් මට්ටමින්ද එසේ කළ හැකිද? යම් මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්කයක් ජයගන්නා අපේක්ෂකයා සෑමවිටම මුළු ජනධිපතිවරණයද ජයගන්නා ප්‍රවනතාවයක් පවතීද?

පොලොන්නරු මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්කයේ ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ තුනම බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ බව අවධානවත් කියවන්නන්ට පෙනෙන්නට ඇති. එබැවින් සමස්ත පොලොන්නරු මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්කයද බෙල්වෙදර් දිස්ත්‍රික්කයකි.

කොළඹ, ගම්පහ, කුරුණෑගල, පුත්තලම, මහනුවර, කෑගල්ල, රත්නපුර, මොණරාගල සහ හම්බන්තොට යන මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්ක ජයගන්නා අපේක්ෂකයා සිවු වරක් මුළු ජනධිපතිවරණයද ජයගත් අතර එක වරක් ජය නොගත්තේය.

ප්‍රතිශත බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ මෙන්ම අපට ප්‍රතිශත බෙල්වෙදර් මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්කද විශ්ලේෂණය කළ හැක. අවසාන ප්‍රතිඵලයේ ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශතවලට සමානතම ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිශත ඇති මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්ක මෙසේය:

## බෙල්වෙදර් පිළිබඳ වැරදි වැටහීම්

### "පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් යන්න නොවෙනස්වන ලක්ෂණයකි."

නොවැම්බර් 16 දින මැතිවරණයෙන් පසුව, ඔබ ප්‍රතිඵල නරබනවා යැයි සිතමු. සජිත් ප්‍රේමදාසා මොරටු ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශය ජයගන්නා යැයි උපකල්පනය කරමු. එ.ජ.ප. අපේක්ෂකයා මුළු මැතිවරණයද ජයගන්නා බව ඔබට නිගමනය කළ හැකිද?

එසේ කළ නොහැක. බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයක "පූර්ණත්වය" යනු එය සමස්තයක් ලෙස රටේ ප්‍රතිඵලයට කොතරම් හොඳින් ගැලපේද යන්නයි. බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ දේශපාලන පක්ෂවලට සහයෝගය දක්වන්නේ සමස්තයක් ලෙස රට මෙම පක්ෂවලට සහයෝගය දක්වන ආකාරයට බැවිනි. මේ සහයෝග ස්වභාවය වෙනස් විය හැක.

පළමු ජනාධිපතිවරණයේදී (1982) එ.ජ.ප. අපේක්ෂක ජේ. ආර්. ජයවර්ධන ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයක 160න් 137ක් ජයග්‍රහණය කළේය. එබැවින්, මෙම පළමු මැතිවරණයෙන් පසුව, ඡන්ද කොට් 137ක් (නාමිකව) "පූර්ණ" බෙල්වෙදර් විය. එසේම, තනි මැතිවරණයක් තනි නියැදියකි. තනි නියැදියකින් ගණනය කළ ඇස්තමේන්තුවක සංඛ්‍යානමය වැදගත්කමද අඩුය.

පසුකාලීන මැතිවරණවලින් පසු, බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශය ගණන පහත වැටෙන අතර ඇස්තමේන්තුවල සංඛ්‍යානමය වැදගත්කමද වැඩිවේ:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RKlBxuED2B-ElJ6IgbcO7Q.png)

2015 මැතිවරණයට පෙර, පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ 44 ක් තිබුණි. අවිස්සාවෙල්ල එවැනි ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයකි. 2015ට පෙර ජනාධිපතිවරණ හයේම, අවිස්සාවෙල්ල ජයගත් අපේක්ෂකයා මුළු ජනාධිපතිවරණයද ජයගත්තේය.

2015 මැතිවරණයෙන් පසු ඔබ ප්‍රතිඵල නරබනවා යැයි සිතමු. අවිස්සාවෙල්ල ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශය අපේක්ෂක මහින්ද රාජපක්ෂ ජයගැනීම ඔබ දුටුවා යැයි සිතමු.

එ.ජ.නි.ස. අපේක්ෂකයා මැතිවරණය ජයග්‍රහණය කර ඇති බව ඔබට නිගමනය කළ හැකිද? එසේ කළ නොහැක.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AI0CKUj9SrSJ1Xwo70tioQ.png)

2015 දී අවිස්සාවෙල්ල පරාජිත අපේක්ෂකයා මැතිවරණයද ජයගත් අතර , අවිස්සාවෙල්ලට "පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර්" තත්ත්වය අහිමි විය.

### "සියලුම පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් දිනා ගැනීමට අපේක්ෂකයින් උත්සාහ කළ යුතුය."

බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ වල ඡන්ද රටා සමස්ත රටේ ඡන්ද රටා වලට බොහෝ සමානය. එහෙත්, බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ වල ඡන්ද රටා සහ සමස්ත රටේ ඡන්ද රටා අතර හේතු සම්බන්ධතාවයක් නොමැත.

එනිසා, බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ දිනා ගැනීමට උත්සාහ කිරීම (නිදසුනක් වශයෙන්, එවැනි ප්‍රදේශවල වැඩිපුර ජනරැලි පැවැත්වීම), සමස්ත රට තුල වැඩි ඡන්ද ප්‍රමාණයක් ලැබීමට හේතු නොවනු ඇත. මෙසේ කිරීමෙන් අපේක්ෂකයාට බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශය දිනා ගත හැකි වුවත්, රට අහිමි විය හැකි. ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශයටද (අවිස්සාවෙල්ලට සිදුවූ අන්දමින්) බෙල්වෙදර් තත්වය අහිමි විය හැකිය.

එසේ වුවද, ඡන්දදායකයින්ගේ මනාපයන් සහ අවශ්‍යතා ගැන දැන ගැනීමට බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ උචිත ස්ථාන විය හැක. මෙවැනි ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ , සමස්තයක් ලෙස රට සඳහා "නියැදි භූමි" ලෙස ක්‍රියා කළ හැකිය. එහෙත් එවැනි අවබෝධ ලබා ගත් පසු, ඒවා මුළු රටටම ක්‍රියාත්මක කළ යුතුය. බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශ වලට පමණක් සීමා නොවිය යුතුය.

## "පොලොන්නරුව විශේෂයි."

පොලොන්නරුව මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්කය බෙල්වෙදර් මැතිවරණ දිස්ත්‍රික්කයක් වන අතර, එහි ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාශය තුනම බෙල්වෙදර් කොට්ඨාෂද වේ. ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ඓතිහාසික අගනුවරට ජනාධිපතිවරණ වලට සාපේක්ෂව යම් විශේෂ වැදගත්කමක් තිබේද?

මෙසේ සිතීම අධි තක්සේරුවක් විය හැක.

අපේ "ජනාධිපතිවරණ ඉතිහාසය" යුග තුනකට බෙදිය හැක:

* 1982 සහ 1988: "කොළ" යුගය. මේ යුගයේදී, බහුතර සිංහල ඡන්දය එ.ජ.ප.ය ජයගත්තේය. පොලොන්නරුවද එ.ජ.ප.ය ජයගත්තේය.

* 1994, 1999, 2005 සහ 2010: "නිල්" යුගය. 1994 මහ-මැතිවරණය සහ ජනාධිපතිවරණය චන්ද්‍රිකා කුමාරතුංග ජයගත් පසු, බහුතර සිංහල ඡන්දය එ.ජ.ප.ය සිට පො.එ.පෙ. දක්වා සංක්‍රමණය විය. එසේ පොලොන්නරුවද එ.ජ.ප.යට අහිමි විය.

* 2015: "පොලොන්නරු" යුගය. 2015 දීද සිංහල ඡන්දය වැඩි කොටසක් එ.ජ.නි.ස.යේ මහින්ද රාජපක්ෂට ඡන්දය හිමි විය. එහෙත්, රාජපක්ෂ සමග තරඟ කළ මෛත්‍රිපාල සිරිසේන පොලොන්නරු දේශපාලකයෙක් වූ නිසා පොලොන්නරු විෂමතාවක් විය.

එබැවින් සෑම ජනාධිපතිවරණයකදීම ජයග්‍රාහී අපේක්ෂකයාට පොලොන්නරුව සහාය දැක්වීම පුදුමයක් නොවේ.

## ඉතින් 2019යේ ජය කාටද ?

මම නොදනිමි.

වර්තමාන බෙල්වෙදර් කොට්ඨාෂ (මොරටු, රත්මලාන, ජා-එලා, කටාන, මාවතගම, මෙදිරිගිරියා, මින්නේරිය සහ පොලොන්නරු)වාසි ඡන්දදායකයින් කුමක් සිතන්නේදැයිද මම නොදනිමි .සමහරවිට, ඔබ දන්නවා ඇති.

ඔබ රත්මලාන ගොස්, රත්මාලාන වාසීන් සමඟ කතා කොට, ඔවුන් සියල්ලන්ම යම් අපේක්ෂකයකුට ඡන්ද දීමට තීරණය කළ ඇතිබව දැනගතහොත්, ඔබට පහත නිගමන තුනෙන් එකකට එළඹිය හැක:

* එක්කෝ එම අපේක්ෂකයා ජයග්‍රහණය කරන අතර, රත්මලාන පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාෂයක් ලෙස තව දුරටත් පැවතෙනු ඇත.

* නැතහොත් එම අපේක්ෂකයා ජයග්‍රහණය නොකරන අතර, රත්මලාන ඡන්ද කොට්ඨාෂයට එහි පූර්ණ බෙල්වෙදර් තත්ත්වය අහිමි වනු ඇත.

* නැත්නම්, රත්මාලාන වාසීන් ප්‍රමාණවත් ගණනකට ඔබ කථා කර නැත!

එබැවින්ත, තත්ත්වය බොහෝ සරලය.

සුබ මැතිවරණයක් වේවා!

# Two Types of Launches

### Strategic and Tactical

The best organisations try to design, build and launch products in a scientific way. An essential aspect of this scientific method is scientific experimentation. When a product is launched, its impact must be measured. And this impact must be meaningful and significant.

But not all product launches are equal. And in this article, I want to discuss two very different types of product launches.

## Tactical Product Launches

Suppose you run an e-commerce web service (like Amazon). And suppose you want to change the colour of the check-out button. From a dull grey, say, to an exciting orange.

You could make the change and push it to every user. But then, you won't be able to measure the impact of the change.

Hence, you run an A/B test. From your many users, you pick two small, similar and equal-sized groups. You launch the new orange button to one group (let's call this group "B"), and the other group ("A") sees the old grey button. After a couple of days, you look at various metrics for the two groups, including the number button clicks. If "A" results in "X" check-outs per day, and "B" results in "Y", and "Y" is (statistically) significantly bigger than "X". And you could conclude that the orange button is better than the old grey one.

There are other things you should also be aware of. For example, you should look at different metrics (like revenue and accidental clicks). But my point is this: You can test the impact of your launch with an A/B test. Using statistical means.

## Strategic Launches

The word strategy originates from the Greek word stratēgia (στρατηγία), which means "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship". It refers to "a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty".

The key word is "uncertainty". If a strategy does not involve significant uncertainty, then it is not strategy. It is a tactic. The word "significant" is also vital. For me, "significant uncertainty" means that the strategy cannot be validated before it is enacted using scientific or strategic means.

Consider your e-commerce web service, where you changed the check-out button from dull grey to exciting orange. Now, suppose you want to make a much more significant change. You want to completely re-wamp the check-out flow. You change the order of steps. You add new payment methods. You change the underlying back end. And you use a new client-side framework with new widgets.

The change will be expensive, but you expect it to be significantly better for customers. Initially, there will be bugs, and customers have some learning curve before they get used to the product. But in the end, it will be positive. Or so you believe.

While this type of "big change" happens all the time, it is much harder to test. In theory, we can use the same experiment process we used for the orange button launch. We could run an A/B test.

In practice, this is problematic. For this type of change, the effect might not be visible for months. Hence, we will need to run the test for several months. This would also mean that while some users get to see the new product, others are left with the old one.

Hence, very often, these big launches are just launched. Without experiment. You make a "strategic decision" to launch the big launch.

## Tactical vs Strategic Launches

Both tactical and strategic product launches have pros and cons.

On the one hand, tactical product launches are safe and scientific. If the test tells you they are good, they probably are good. A tactical approach is incremental and evolutionary.

On the other hand, tactical product launches don't lead to leaps of innovation or revolutions in technology. Hence, while strategic product launches might be criticised as rash and unscientific, an organisation needs them from time to time. As purely tactical execution might lead to local optima. Escaping these might need a revolution, as opposed to evolution.

### Identification

The important point is to recognise each for what it is. It is foolish to launch a tactical change without experiment and validation as if it were a strategic change. It is also a waste of time spending time and resources, trying to show that a strategic change is statistically significant.

### Balance

It is also essential to strike the right balance between tactical and strategic launches. An organisation with no strategic launches will not innovate and die a slow death. One without tactical launches will run out of time and resources and die a quick death.

The ideal balance is many tactical launches, punctuated by a small number of strategic launches from time to time.

At Facebook, we had an unwritten rule that teams should work on the following types of projects: 70% of time and resources on safe projects (tactical), 20% somewhat unsafe (more strategic), and 10% on crazy ideas (very strategic).

Part of the rule was the expected chance of success: the 70% projects were expected to have a 70% chance of success. The 20% a 20% chance of success. And 10% a 10% chance.

### Execution

The tactical approach is safer. And often a strategic launch can be decomposed into a series of tactical launches. If this is possible, then this is the smarter approach. On the other hand, sometimes this decomposition is not possible. Sometimes, all the components of the strategic launch must be launched simultaneously.

### Incentives

Tactical launches have small impacts and small risks. Strategic launches have (potential) large impacts, but large risks. The organisation and its employees should understand these risks and impacts well. Ideally, employees should have corresponding incentives.

Junior employees are usually responsible for tactical launches. Large strategic launches are almost always the decisions of senior employees, often the CEO of the organisation.

The two types of launches need very different compensation. The success or failure of tactical launches is visible in the short term. And hence, employees can be compensated accordingly (e.g. through bonuses).

The benefits (and costs) of strategic launches are only visible in the longer term. One problem with present-day executive compensation is that this long term is not taken into account. For example, during the financial crises, bank executives made many rash strategic decisions, which might have had short term benefits, but had substantial long term costs. However, they received huge bonuses well before the effects of their rash decisions were obvious.

Hence, incentives and compensations should be aligned with time-frame. Tactical Launches should have short-term compensation, while Strategic launches should have long-term compensation structures.

# Karma

### That cosmic bank-account that is not

If I take your eye out, Karma will ensure that my eye will also be taken out. The same applies to your and my teeth. "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.." so it goes. A cosmic bank account, that keeps track of everything we've done, and ensures justice. Over some arc. I don't know how long. Apparently.

This view has always been problematic for me. For three reasons.

## Justice, Accounting and Certainty

### 1. Justice

Is there justice in the world? Actually? Too many things feel too unjust and too arbitrary. So many people who have never taken anyone else's eye out, or have never done anything terrible, get their eyes and teeth pulled out.

### 2. Accounting

If there were some cosmic ledger that kept track of everyone's deeds, where exactly is it? How is it stored? Can we take a look at it? Perhaps do an audit? Who has eyes and teeth in credit? Who has debt? Is there interest?

### 3. Certainty

I don't believe in many things, but there is one thing I do believe in: Uncertainty.

Two factors drive my personal beliefs. The first is my (no doubt meagre) knowledge of theoretical physics. The world is made up of entirely random matter and events. The second is my (even more shallow) knowledge of Buddhist cosmology. For the wise, "the future is uncertain, unpredictable, and unknowable".

If so, can we expect justice to act with any certainty? If I take your eye out, all I can say is that either my eye will be taken out (if you seek to take revenge on me, for example), or it will not be taken out (if you, for example, forgive me). I can't say anything with certainty. Revenge and forgiveness are far more real than justice, and uncertainty is far more real (and certain) than all these things.

## The, inevitable, other hand

On the other hand, if I were to take your tooth out, I would feel bad about it. Hence, even if you don't take revenge on me, there is some lousy side-effect that I feel, often instantly. Something is clearly "going on", and probably deserves more analysis.

Why would I want to take your tooth out? Probably because I greed after a future where you miss a tooth, and suffer the resulting indignities. From pain to a warped appearance, to ridicule from society.

While you have a perfect set of teeth in the present, I crave a future where that perfectness is diminished. 32 (a nice prime power of the smallest prime number) becomes 31 (a prime, but a unexceptional prime none-the-less).

And so, driven by that craving, and a belief in your toothless future, I act. A well-aimed uppercut neatly dislodges your upper left incisor.

But then, after achieving this future, and certainty that I craved, I feel bad about it. Why? Well, if I were a psychopath, I might not feel bad about it. And that seems even more interesting. So let's talk about that.

## Karma and the psychopath

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SrBLB-RSsrpANb-Z0uPRLw.jpeg)

I (psychopath) dislodge your tooth and walk away smiling. Where is Karma now? What happens next? Perhaps, nothing.

Except that I (the psychopath) believes in a specific set of things. I believe in the possibility of certain futures. Futures where you loose teeth. I believe in craving for ideas and getting them. "Things" like futures where you miss teeth. This belief could lead to other things.

My belief in a certain future that is bad will lead to me feeling anxious. A belief in one that is good will lead to hope — which might lead to sadness if that hope is not satisfied. And if I can believe in the future, I can also believe in a past. And with that belief, just like anxiety and hope, comes regret and nostalgia. And with these bad things, come other bad things.

Hence, we see how even a psychopath will not be able to walk away, smiling. For before long, something else will catch-up. Not the bank-balance type of Karma. But a far more powerful Karma. One that is beyond to justice, accounting, and certainty.

This Karma is beyond justice because instead of saying "if you do bad things, then bad things will happen to you" it says "if you believe in bad things, then you believe in bad things". It is beyond accounting because instead of saying "You did a bad thing. Your Karma balance is now 132,000κ (κ, or "kappa" the international unit of Karma)" it says "You did a bad thing. So, you did a bad thing". Finally, and most importantly, it is beyond certainty because instead of relying on certainty, it punishes belief in certainty. No certainty and there is no Karma.

## That cosmic bank-account that is not

Hence, if I do take your eye or tooth out, perhaps Karma will get me. But, perhaps, not the way you (or many people) think. And certainty not with any certainty.

# On Non-Voters

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

Turnout is the proportion of the voters who actually voted, to the voters who were registered (hence, eligible) to vote. The turnout in the 2015 presidential election was 81.52%, and the highest in presidential election history. Of the 15,044,490 voters registered to vote 12,264,377 turned-up and voted on election day.

The lowest turnout was in the 1988 presidential election, wherein the midst of two civil conflicts (one with the LTTE, and one with the JVP), turnout plunged to 55.32%. The 2005 presidential election was also controversial, turnout-wise, with the LTTE ordering voters in the north to boycott the poll.

I define a "non-voter" as a voter who was registered to vote (hence, eligible), but didn't or couldn't (as many in 1988 and 2005) vote. If turnout is even across the country, "non-voting" does not affect the final result, as all parties will get the same proportion of additional votes if the non-voters voted. However, this is seldom the case. Usually, there are significant differences in turn-out across the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vgsN-YSbYTkZQYk_NMN-YQ.png)

## 2015

As an aide to analyzing turnout, and non-voting, I first define "deltas" and "non-voter votes."

### Deltas

To win a presidential election, a candidate must win more than 50% of the total valid votes. I define a delta as the difference between the number of votes a candidate wins in a polling division or an electoral district, and 50% of the total valid votes in that polling division or electoral district. Hence, if the candidates total delta is greater than zero, the candidate wins the election.

This is a map of the deltas the NDF and UPFA got across the country in 2015.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MW7wUCe4uJSzKKun6mnMnQ.png)

For example, in the Colombo Electoral District, the total number of valid votes was 1,296,360. Half (50%) of that is 648,180. The NDF candidate won 725,073. Hence, the NDF delta is 76,893 (~77K).

More intuitively, deltas represent the "lead" a party had in an electoral district. And if a party's "leads" added-up across the nation is positive, they win the election.

### Non-Voter Votes

By "non-voter votes" I mean the votes the voters who would not have voted would have cast.

For example, in the 2015 presidential election, the Colombo-North polling division had 89,771 registered voters. Of these voters, 69,795 or 77.75% voted. 19,976 or 22.25% did not vote. These are the "non-voters" of Colombo-North.

Now, the NDF won 51,537 votes in Colombo-North, while the UPFA won 16,423. If we assume that the non-voters would have voted in the same proportion as the voters, the NDF and the UPFA would have got an additional 14,750 and 4,700 votes respectively.

Important: The assumption that "non-voters would have voted in the same proportion as the voters" is not always valid. For example, often non-voters might be apathetic to most parties and might have voted for a minor party, or even rejected their votes. Also, non-voters in a polling division may be biased towards a single party.

Assuming we accept the assumption as reasonable, we can aggregate polling division non-voter votes at the electoral district level. For example, adding Colombo-North and other Colombo electoral district polling divisions gives a total 171,037 and 124,361 non-voter votes for the NDF and the UPFA respectively.

We can plot the Vote Delta map, for just the non-voter votes. This represents the "additional lead' a party would have got if the non-voters voted.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LiXgBON_85udFZ4-NSqMNw.png)

Most of the non-voters were in NDF leaning electoral districts, and hence non-voters voting would not have changed the outcome of the election.

## 2010

In 2010, the UPFA candidate won with 57.88% of the vote, to the NDF candidate's 40.15%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TqGWM74nOed5RcMl5qsGaQ.png)

We have the same conclusion as 2015 for 2010. Except for the other party.

Non-voters votes would have emphasised the UPFA victory margin, even though there was a significant number of non-voters in NDF leaning electoral districts like Jaffna.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*os23EAoOt3yrOAHmKINLqQ.png)

## 2005

The 2005 presidential election was the closest in Sri Lankan history. The UPFA won 50.29% of the vote, just 180,786 votes more than the UNP's 48.43%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N3CcwnnB1o5zW4GhFMtYVw.png)

Assuming our "non-voter votes" assumption holds, the UNP would have won 143K extra votes in Jaffna alone, possibly securing the election.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gX612X6z1mDEN6QxPVaBqg.png)

Compared to 2015, the UNP delta is significantly lower in many electoral districts, including Colombo. They might have won the election in spite of the LTTE boycott if they did better in some of these districts. See On Floating Votes for more thoughts on this.

## 1988

The 1988 Presidential Election was held amid two bloody conflicts: One with the LTTE in the north and east. The other with the JVP in many other parts of the country. As a result of President Jayawardena's Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Indian peace-keeping forces had also entered the country. Unsurprisingly, turnout was only 55.32%, down from 81.06% in 1982. Voting was not held in LTTE controlled parts of the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hstj6YK76H9yCYX3G9JTbg.png)

While voter turnout was very low in LTTE controlled areas, this is not completely visible in the delta statistic because the vote was split between the UNP, SLFP and SLPP in these areas. More turnout would not have significantly added to the UNP or SLFP delta. On the other hand, in Sinhala majority areas where the JVP insurrection was serious, the low voter turnout significantly affected the deltas.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XAtktWKXZKKQ5DNL1S314Q.png)

## Conclusions for 2019

On the one hand, turnout and non-voting will play a significant part in the November 16th election, especially if the results are close. On the other hand, it is difficult to say what candidates and parties should be doing about this, beyond encouraging as many supporters to vote. In other words, "Campaign 101" stuff.

# The Problem with Binary Voting

### Reflections on Brexit

On the 23rd of June, 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU. The referendum was close with ~52% (17,410,742 voters) voting to leave, and ~48% (16,141,241 voters) voting to remain.

I don't want to argue about the pros and cons of leaving or remaining. Instead, I want to point out some problems in the referendum itself. And possibly suggest an alternative.

## Timing

This graph presents opinion poll results from 2015 to 2018, on how the British populace supported leave and remain. For most of late 2015 and early 2016, the British narrowly supported remain. Then just before the referendum leave took a narrow lead, which it maintained for the rest of 2016. Then, starting in early 2017 remain retook the lead.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_3xk4tIc81Jv1zSyYAASrA.png)

Hence, the time of the referendum vote played a huge role in the outcome. If the vote was held in April 2016 or June 2017, remain might have won. Again, I'm not saying remain should have won. I'm just pointing out the significance "timing" played in Brexit. And this feels uncomfortable and arbitrary. Why should time play a role?

## Disappointment

For the entire period depicted in the graph above, support for remain and leave did not fall below ~42% and ~40% respectively. Hence, when leave won the referendum, at least 42% of the country would have been disappointed by the result.

At the same time, any hypothetical vote in April 2016 or June 2017 would have resulted in at least 40% of the country being disappointed.

## Binary Trivialisation

The biggest problem (not implied in the graph) was probably holding a referendum in the first place. I.e. trivializing and simplifying a very complicated question into a simple yes/no vote.

If we've learned anything from the countless deals and the failed votes in parliament is that Brexit is complex and complicated. Then why was it decomposed into a simple yes/no vote?

## An alternative?

I don't really have an alternative. But perhaps, a sliver of an iota of a drop of an idea.

What if the 52% to 48% result was interpreted differently? Instead of trivializing it as a simple yes/no, what if the full proportion was taken into account? And what if a committee of 52 leave-MPs and 48 remain-MPs were formed to define and negotiate a deal with the EU?

And to take into account the variance in peoples views, what if any decision within the 100 MP committee needed a majority of at least 20? I.e. at least 60 MPs must be in favour?

As I said, this is not a proper alternative. But there might be something in it.

# The Sub-Two-Hour Marathon

Why Eliud Kipchoge's run was so special

On the 12th of October, at the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya became the first human to run a Marathon (42.195 km) in under two hours, completing the distance in one hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds.

To be fair, Ineos was an unofficial event. The official rules were somewhat bent to maximise the chances of breaking the 2 hour barrier. Everything from route, to location, to weather, to footware was optimized. Hence, the performance will not update the official marathon world record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds, also held by Kipchoge.

But the performance is still very special. Many scientists believed that it was anatomically impossible for a human to run 42.195 km in less two hours. They have ben proved wrong.

Kipchoge's average speed of 5.88 meters per second (m/s), would also have achieved the world record for every race from the 3000m to the half-marathon, at various points in the last 100 years.

For example, the record average speed for the 3000m in 1920 was 5.85 m/s. For the 5000m in 1920 was 5.70m/s, and in 1940 was 5.89 m/s, marginally faster than Kipchoge's time. For the 10,000m, the record average speed in 1960 was 5.85 m/s. And the record for the half-marathon in 1980 was 5.62m/s.

# On P-Values

### Do Jelly Beans cause Acne?

>>> "Do Jelly Beans cause Acne?"

We ask some scientists to test this hypothesis. The scientists reply,

>>> "We found no link between JBs and Acne (p > 5%)"

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gujXgrAJopvk4ZMy73K-Sw.png)

We understand the "no link between JBs and Acne" bit, but what is "p"? And what is the significance of "p > 5%."

To understand "p", we have to investigate how scientists use statistics to examine questions like "Do Jelly Beans cause Acne?". They usually have "tests" to detect if (say) JBs cause Acne.

## Tests

A "test" could consist of mixing the JBs with a mysterious chemical and seeing if a red precipitate results.

The outcome of the test has some connection with what you want to know. For example, if we mix JBs with a mysterious chemical and red crystals precipitate, we might conclude that JBs do indeed cause Acne.

On the other hand, if no red crystals appear, we might find that JBs do not cause Acne.

Now, most tests are not perfect. So the connection between the outcome of the test and you want to know might not be deterministic. There might be some noise.

For example, there might be some cases where JBs cause Acne, but the test is negative (i.e. No red crystals). And there might be some cases where the JBs don't cause Acne, but the test is positive (i.e. Red crystals appear).

In Statistics-speak, the two types of cases are known as false negatives and false positives, respectively.

## p-values

And, so, what is the significance of "p > 5%"

When a scientist says that the p-value of a test is greater than something (say 5%), she means that the chance that the test returns positive but should return negative is > 5%. Or in statistics-speak, the chance of a false positive is > 5%.

If we overlook this, we could misinterpret the results of our test.

For example, since the false positive rate for our JB-test is greater than 5% (or 1 in 20), if we repeat the test 20 times on safe JBs, we are likely to get one positive result (falsely) indicating that JBs cause acne.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dpWAy8lxRhJf0J-bdG9GFg.png)

Far too often, statistics, reported everywhere, from the media to even esteemed academic journals, suffer from this problem.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*V4_tJjElh0Fs_iUtXdJx_A.png)

## What about false negatives?

What was the false-negative rate of our JB-test? What was the probability that there is no red precipitate, but the JBs do indeed cause Acne? Why didn't the scientists report this?

With most statistical tests, there is an implicit assumption that the negative state is more common than the positive state. For example, that most JBs do not cause Acne. In statistics-speak, this negative state is known as the "null hypothesis".

For example, suppose that most JBs (say 99%) are safe, and 1% cause acne. Suppose we test 10,000 JBs. 9,900 of these are safe; 100 cause acne.

Since our false positive rate > 5%, of the 9,900 safe JBs, the test will return positive for > 495 samples, and negative for < 9,405.

Now suppose that our false-negative rate is very high. Let's say that it is 50%. That is, for a JB that does cause Acne, there is a 50% chance that the test returns negative.

That means, for our 100% unsafe JBs, the test will return positive for 50 and negative for 50.

Let's look at the performance of our test as a whole.

For 9,405 of the safe JBs and 50 of the unsafe JBs, the test was correct. For > 495 safe JBs and 50 unsafe JBs, the test was incorrect. The point to note is that 495 > 50. I.e. even if the false-negative rate is much higher than the false positive rate, if there are far more negatives than positives, then the absolute number of false positives will be considerably higher than the absolute number of false positives.

Assuming this, scientists often only report the false positive rate, by way of the p-value.

If the assumption "the negative state is more common than the positive state" breaks down, so does "the absolute number of false positives will be far greater than the absolute number of false positives".

Just as p-values are ignored and misinterpreted, many analyses wrongly assume these assumptions.

## Staying safe from Statistics

Always ask the following questions:

* What is the false-negative rate? Many studies avoid reporting this. For example, that is the chance of a JB causing Acne if no red precipitate is observed?

* What is the actual prevalence of positives and negatives? Are there more safe JBs than Acne causing JBs? Is "the negative state is more common than the positive state" assumption reasonable?

Usually, humans are far more likely to mislead than statistics. Hence you should more importantly also ask:

* How does a positive outcome impact the scientist?

* How does a negative outcome impact the scientist?

* Would one or the other result in higher pay, more awards, or more prestige?

# A Machine's Opinion

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

>>> Are all Sri Lankan polling divisions the same? Are some different from others?

If you ask a Sri Lankan this question, you're likely to get many answers. Some interesting. Some boring. But what if you don't ask a Sri Lankan? What if you don't even ask a human? What if you ask a machine?

In Computer Science-speak the term "Clustering" refers to:

>>> ...the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters) [Wikipedia]

We could give a machine some data about polling divisions, and see how it might cluster them. What it decides to put into what cluster would depend on the its answer to the question:

>>> "Are all Sri Lankan polling divisions the same? Are some different from others?"

## Details on the Methodology

For each of the last four presidential elections (1999 to 2015), I represent each polling division (and postal votes result) by the percentage votes won by the Blues (SLFP, PA, or UPFA), Greens (UNP, or NDF), and others.

For example, Mawathagama would be:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EiGg2POYNogWqtzoTkJZIQ.png)

Next, I asked a machine (my laptop), to cluster this data using K-means clustering. The "K" refers to the number of clusters.

## The Results

### The Singleton Cluster (K = 1)

Why build a "cluster" of size one? Would it not consist of all the data points? All the election results for the country? It would.

However, running the K-means cluster algorithm with K = 1 is interesting, because it gives you a sense of how various polling divisions are distributed relative to the islandwide result.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5t0Xq6yWCcYw79RfvxY8pA.png)

Let's see what the machine outputs:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m47TXsq4vakYVCCY5B-KBQ.png)

The mean of the cluster represents the "average results" for the members of that cluster. With this singleton cluster, the mean is the average result of the entire country.

The machine also outputs the members of the cluster. And the distance of each member is from the mean of the cluster.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2oHdSI9SL_ugkKYEubqmAQ.png)

Distance is the summed absolute difference between each percentage statistics for the member and the mean. For example, the various results for "Mawathagama" differs from the final islandwide result (the mean for this cluster) by a sum of 8.9%. I have sorted the cluster members in order of distance from the mean.

The polling divisions closest to the mean of the singleton cluster (Mawathagama, Yatinuwara, Moratuwa, Pelmadulla, and Teldeniya etc) are the polling divisions that have the results closest to the national results. They are equivalent to "percentage bellwethers" that I presented in Bellwether Polling Divisions.

### Safe Green and Leans Blue (K = 2)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*j91FAS87ZIF_PLkbLTSIXA.png)

With K = 2, the machine "sees" the most obvious way Sri Lankan polling are different: many lean Blue, while others lean Green.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AXXM_5StHe3bXC9z3LWWHw.png)

The first cluster (2.1) represents about 15.2% of the voters, and consists of Safe Green polling divisions, which tend to vote 60–75% for the Greens. The results closest to the mean are Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya, Kalkudah, Jaffna, Puttalam and Colombo North.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bGBQb9ZB7Qim4o5Mpqf7YQ.png)

The second cluster (2.2) is much larger, and consists of polling divisions that tend to vote 50–60% for Blue. The results closest to the mean are Mirigama, Divulapitiya, Avissawella, Horowupotana, and Kalutara.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Zsvm-b2S4Z8ZGSMf5qPmyg.png)

While the K =2 pattern is interesting, it is somewhat obvious, and we could like more nuance. So let's try K = 3.

### Swing Polling Divisions (K = 3)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f0HKDYwfjsHJMUAgEfKLIQ.png)

With K = 3, we see a new type of polling division: Swing polling divisions.

The smaller Safe Green (2.1) cluster stays largely the same (as 3.1), with the exception of its mean changing from Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya to Colombo North. This is because some of its members moved to other clusters. This is a common phenomenon with clustering. Cluster identities are somewhat arbitrary, and tend to change.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_JoKSmgz9BrTHRzCbF4P4w.png)

Cluster 2.2 splits into two new clusters. A Swing result cluster (3.2) and a Safe Blue cluster (3.3).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_hZpAeLzMpQ04HpwtVLLUQ.png)

The Swing polling divisions voted for the Greens in 2005 and 2015, and the Blues in 1999 and 2010. They would have likely "swung" the election to the Greens in 2005, had the LTTE-driven boycott not happened. In most elections, the gap between winner and looser was close. The results closest to the mean are Kundasale, Beruwala, Rattota, Bandarawela and Kurunegala.

The Safe Blue polling divisions tend to vote 55% to 65% for the Blues. Results closest to the mean are Kegalle, Bandaragama, Balapitiya, Horana, and Hiniduma.

### Safer Blue Polling Divisions (K = 4)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1cduTb3OxbrOKBzHYwC72A.png)

Cluster 4.1 and 4.2 are similar to the Safe Green and Swing clusters 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. We see a split of the Safe Blue cluster (3.3) into two new clusters 4.3 and 4.4.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*znGbP5D47ENxU0OHMpCn6A.png)

Cluster 4.3 is still Safe Blue, voting about 50% to 60% for Blue.

Cluster 4.4 is Safer Blue, with support for Blue over 55%.

### Blue except 2015 (K = 5)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6VkqHWLnwjNrzshdtHCRmg.png)

Clusters 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 are very similar to clusters 4.1 (Safe Green), 4.2 (Swing), and 4.3 (Safe Blue). We see Cluster 4.4 (Safer Blue) split into two new clusters.

Cluster 5.5 is very similar to 4.4, with support for Blue over 60%.

Cluster 5.4 is more interesting. While historically it supported Blue with nearly 60% on average, in 2015, Green had a much stronger showing, with a vote of nearly 50%. The results closest to the mean included Biyagama, Panadura, Minuwangoda, Kaduwela, and Kalutara.

### K ≥ 6

We could continue clustering for larger K, but I think we have enough data to answer our original question.

## A human interprets on behalf of the machine

Here's a summary of what our machine did:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3Rny_YwW8a6U89rhBw1FTQ.png)

K = 5, is our machine's final answer to the question, "Are all polling divisions the same?". It says, "no". And it goes on to describe five quite different types of polling divisions.

The next obvious question is,

>>> "Can we use what the machine said, to predict the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election?"

On the first inspection, it might seem that Green has no chance. This would probably be the case if the next election was first-past-the-post. Blue would likely win a majority polling divisions. However, presidential elections are different beasts. Each vote matters equally.

Let's do some more detailed math.

Consider the "Safe Green" cluster. Using the cluster mean as a guide, we could estimate that the Greens would probably get 55.1% to 78.0%, while the Blues would get 19.9% to 40.4% of the vote. Considering that the safe green cluster is about 11% of votes, this would equate to 6.1% to 8.6% votes islandwide for the Greens, while the Blues would get 2.2% to 4.4% islandwide.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PoJXyRuShT65b7KszpVD3A.png)

Applying this logic to all the clusters, we get the following aggregate statistics:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aieN22u8ptW1nS6A1SOByA.png)

Green would probably get between 38.4% and 51.2% of the vote, and the Blues between 46.4% and 59.1%. The lower bounds are similar to the 39% and 44% numbers that I computed in On Floating Voters. Hence, at least by these numbers, the elections is still wide(ish) open.

## Concluding Thoughts (by a Human)

Statistics assumes that "the future will be like the past". This might not be the case. The 2019 presidential election could be nothing like 1999, 2005, 2010 and 2015, upon which my laptop pontificated. We might even have a completely different "colour" winning the election. Hence, as always, administer that cautionary pinch of salt.

On the other hand, the "Machine's Opinion" is (at least for me) quite interesting. For example,

* Come post-November 16th, I'll be keeping an eye on the "percentage bellwether" type polling divisions unearthed by the K =1 clustering. Like Mawathagama, Yatinuwara, Moratuwa, Pelmadulla, and Teldeniya. Their results are likely to match the final islandwide result closely.

* I'll also keep an eye on the 30 or so Swing polling divisions. Like Wattala, Udunuwara, Matale, Harispattuwa and Mawanella.

* Then there are the mysterious Safe (except 2015) Blue polling divisions like Biyagama, Panadura, Minuwangoda, Kaduwela, and Kalutara. Will there be "exceptions" in 2019 also?

Happy Voting!

# On Power

### A Sri Lankan Citizen's wishlist

In a representative democracy, citizens elect various representatives to help meet various needs that the state is expected to meet. From defence to finance to foreign affairs. This delegation involves a transfer of power. From citizen to representative. For example, when citizens elect a president or an MP, they implicitly endow that representative with power. Immense amounts of power.

I'm a Sri Lankan citizen. And I'm not (entirely) happy with how power works in our democracy. Things can improve.

And that is what this article is about.

## Delegatability of Power

I live in the Colombo Electoral District, which has over 1.5 million registered voters, and elects 19 MPs to parliament.

If you want to enter parliament from Colombo, you need to compete for 1.5 million people. Against dozens of other candidates.

This demands a considerable investment, probably 100s of millions of rupees. This is not only a massive barrier for most potential candidates, but it also induces many to seek favours from undesirable sources. Favours that demand return.

It is also a problem for the voters. Of the 19 Colombo MPs, I have probably seen five or six in person. That too speaking at various public forums, where the audience is anonymous. Perhaps none of them has ever heard of me or knows my views or needs.

Hence, we have a bunch of "representatives" with no connection to the people they "represent". The process by which citizens delegate power to representatives is completely broken.

At the core if this problem is a blind proportional representation system. While it has some advantages, we blindly ignore its many disadvantages. We should replace blind proportional representation with an alternative, which makes power more delegatable.

## Controllability of Power

There is an unhealthy connection between our legislature and executive. While MPs are nominally elected to the legislature, in reality, they aspire to high posts in the executive. Cabinet ministerships in top ministries. Often the Executive presidency itself.

Citizens have no control over who gets appointed to these high posts. Like the Minister of Defence, Finance, or Foreign Affairs.

Sometimes, high positions go to senior members of the party, or those who get the most number of votes. This criteria, while not ideal, at least, has some degree of transparency and rationale.

However, too often, high positions go to shady dealers who hold the right cards in power-politics. People in power owe these powerful people powerful favours. The ordinary citizen has no visibility into this dark and undemocratic world.

Hence, there should be a clean break between legislature and executive. Legislators should be restricted to legislating. Experts should execute.

## Suitability of Power

The majority of workers in state ministries and departments are (at least officially) non-political. They are chosen for their professional skills, and many rise through the ranks. The private sector also has qualified experts and technocrats.

The most qualified of these people should lead their respective executive areas. We should have experts in defence lead defence, have experts in finance and economics lead finance, and have experts in diplomacy and international relations lead foreign affairs. Why should an MP with no O-Levels, lead a high office of state?

Just as they make laws, legislators could take part in appointing these executive officials. They could also draft laws that ensure that the executives have the correct qualifications. For example, the executive in charge of finance should have doctoral qualifications in finance or economics and a distinguished record. The law should ensure this.

Making the executive more independent of the legislature, would also "free" legislators to do their jobs better. MPs could focus on understanding their voters needs better and translating them into laws, which the executive can act upon. Instead of worrying about what exchange rates should be.

## Proportionality of Power

Power should be proportional to the job at hand. There is some amount of power an MP needs to do his job. Or some amount of power that a minister of finance needs to do her job. The power concentrated in a single position should not exceed its remit. The separation of legislature and executive indirectly satisfies this need for proportionality.

Power should also be proportional to the human wielding it. However important the job, no human should be given too much power. Since "absolute power corrupts absolutely". Hence, positions with disproportionate power, like that of a quasi-Autocratic Executive President, should be abolished.

## Concluding reflections

There are many reasons why my suggestions would not be practical. The most important is that many powerful people would lose their power. And many people who depend on these powerful people would also loose out. To various degrees.

So how can we implement these ideas? I don't have a good answer. A first step would probably consist of building a power-base of MPs, who agree with this philosophy. And then slowly grow that base.

In parallel, citizens would also need convincing. But I'm sceptical how top-of-mind governance reform is for most people. Too many people have better things to worry about. You don't worry about "checks-and-balances" if you're busy worrying about where your child's next meal cheque comes from.

Also, through all of this, I tacitly assume that a democratic system of government is best for Sri Lanka. Too many Sri Lankans would disagree. Many seem to want a "benevolent dictator" or even a king. And there are not unreasonable reasons for this.

Again, I don't have a good answer. Maybe asking Sri Lanka to be democratic is like expecting an infant boy to be a man. Perhaps we are too immature right now. I also have my reservations about democracy, which I've elaborated in On Democracy.

Eitherway, while I might not be the strongest believer in Democracy, I do want the best for Sri Lanka. And it seems like the way power works (at the moment) is not in Sri Lanka's best interests. That's why we need a change.

[Comment]

Thanks for your comment.

I don't completely understand your point about political nuance.

Could you explain it further? Perhaps with a numerical example to highlight your point?
