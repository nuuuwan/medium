# Voting on Truth

### Politicians, Deep Fakes and Blockchain

## Deep Fakes and Kissing Kiddies

What if a video circulates "the internets". Where a prominent and powerful politician Hon. Loku Banda confesses to a callous and cadaverous crime. And many people believe it to be true.

Soon enough, though, Hon. Loku Banda's supporters claim that the video is a "Deep Fake". And they propagate another video. The "original". Where said Hon. Loku Banda confesses, not to a callous and cadaverous crime. But to kissing kiddies and handling hands.

Which is true? The "fake" or the "original"?

Loku Banda is popular. Half the populace support him. And this half believe the "original" to be true.

You, dear reader, on the other hand, sceptical and discerning, are slow. To jump to conclusions. The "fake" could be true. Or the "original" could be true. Or neither could be true. There is no evidence. One way or the other.

All your friends (the few people you trust) agree with you. And so you adopt agnosticism.

## Relative and Absolute Truth

"1 + 1 = 2" is true. By definition. Because in modern mathematics "the definition of 2" is "that which is 1 + 1".

But there are very few absolutely true things, like "1 + 1 = 2".

Most things are true, on condition that other things are true. "Politician Hon. Loku Banda (LB) is honest" depends on "My friend believes that the Hon. LB is honest". And "I believe that my friend is honest" and "My beliefs are reasonable".

Even truths like "It is raining outside" might depend on "I can see outside" and "I can see that it is raining". And "I'm not hallucinating, and I can trust my senses".

Hence, most things we believe true are relative. Dependent on other truths. Which might not be true. As a result, many people may believe many different (and often contradictory) relative truths.

This is not always a problem. After all, most people might disagree on truths like "the true religion", "the true political or economic system" or the "true way to make bread pudding". Christianity is as true for a true Christian, as Capitalism is true for a true Capitalist.

## Truth by Vote

But sometimes we need a unified version of truth.

What if prominent and powerful Loku Banda is summoned to court. For committing the callous and cadaverous crime. How would the "fake" and "original" videos feature as evidence?

The judiciary would apply some process. To either side with one of the videos, or dismiss both. Either way, the process would "vote" on the videos.

Blockchains also work on this idea. A group of entities that don't necessarily trust each other maintain a shared ledger of data, which they mutually trust to be true. The system "works", as long as at least half the entities are "honest".

But can truth, like blockchain, be decided by vote?

Intuitively, there is something deeply unpleasant about this. To me. Perhaps to you, also.

## The Nature of Truth

But what is truth? Most dictionaries define "true" or "truth" in relation to reality. That which is "true" is that which is "real". Consistent with reality.

But reality is subjective. Dependent on each observer. Each of us see our own version of reality. We can discuss our realities with each other. But we can't truly experience the reality of another. And we can't judge the "trueness" or the "realness" of these "other realities" .

We might judge the reality of another. We might complain that "Common-man Punchi Singno is gullible". Or that "Common-man Punchi Singno trusts Politician Loku Banda too much". But in the end, these judgements are relative to our own.

So, the nature of truth seems highly individual and decentralised. And "voting" on truth might not be unreasonable as it seems.

The "unpleasantness" I felt might stem from my own prejudice. "My truth is more true than everyone else's truth". But everyone else also believes this. And voting breaks any ties.
