Re: Founders should be paid in cash+stock where the total value is a multiplier (<2 series A, changes as you go up) on the general market value in my opinion as what the founders bring to the table cannot be matched with what a professional of the same class can bring the company if she was replaced in the same business in her role.

This is true if the founders are, as you imply, high quality and even exceptional. In practice, not all founders might meet this bar. Even among the exceptional, there is a spectrum.
