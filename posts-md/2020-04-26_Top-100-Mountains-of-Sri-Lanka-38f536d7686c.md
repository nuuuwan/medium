# Top 100 Mountains of Sri Lanka

### From First Principles

What are the 100 tallest mountains in Sri Lanka?

In this article, I answer this question from first principles, using altitude data from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ (which can be downloaded for free).

## "Mountain" Defined

I define a "mountain" as a location with "topographic prominence" of 1000 ft (304.8m) or more.

"Topographic prominence" of a hill is defined as "the height of the hill from the lowest contour line surrounding it, which contains no higher peak".

More intuitively, it is the height of the hill from its "base".

[My 1000ft limit might be somewhat arbitrary. As we will see, some "proper mountains" (like Kikilimana and Kudahagala) have lower prominences. Conversely, many mountains with higher prominences have not been named as mountains.]

## Top 10

Using this definition, and some python scripts, I computed the Top 100 mountains in Sri Lanka. These are the Top 10:

1. Pidurutalagala (2524m/2524m) — 7.001665N,80.772689E

2. Kirigalpotta (2395m/950m) — 6.799334N,80.766028E

3. [Unknown] (2361m/326m) — 7.009159N,80.757702E

4. Totapolakanda (2357m/398m) — 6.833472N,80.819317E

5. Adam's Peak (2243m/1083m) — 6.809326N,80.498751E

6. Great Western Mountain (2216m/462m) — 6.960866N,80.695254E

7. Hakgala (2170m/377m) — 6.918401N,80.810991E

8. Conical Hill (2166m/327m) — 6.912573N,80.776020E

9. [Unknown] (2127m/393m) — 7.076603N,80.732723E

10. Mahakudagala (2100m/395m) — 7.044130N,80.843464E

[The two heights indicated are total altitude from sea level, and topographic prominence. For example, Adam's speak has total altitude from sea level 2243m, and a prominence of 1083m.]

Wikipedia also defined a "Top 10" in its "List of Mountains in Sri Lanka" article. While most of the 10 were common, there were a few exceptions.

Both Kudahagala and Kililimana didn't have sufficient prominence (<1000ft), because they were both very close to two other mountains, Kirigalpotta and Pidurutalagala respectivelly.

Kudahagala fell inside the 2160m contour that included Kirigalpotta.

Kikilimana fell inside the 2000m contour that included Kirigalpotta.

One Three Hill also has insufficient prominence.

Conversely, my list had two Top 10 entries, not listed in Wikipedia. Nor did they seem to have names on Google Maps; though it was clear that they were mountains with high prominence.

## Concluding Request

Some (or many) of the mountains that I list as "[Unknown]" might, in fact, be indeed known and have popular names. Please comment if you have information about them.
