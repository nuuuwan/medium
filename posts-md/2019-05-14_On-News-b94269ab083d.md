## Ancient Times

In the beginning, humans lived in small groups — perhaps a few dozen people — a hundred at most. Everyone knew everyone. "News" consisted of what one person told another person — and was exclusively about things that happened in the group. The "Latency" or "Speed" of news was determined how fast a human could travel. The "Bandwidth" or "Volume" depended on what a human could remember.

For 1000s of years, not much changed. Latency got a little faster as news was carried by animals (horses and pigeons), and then physical machines (trains). With the printed word, the "precision" of news improved. But "Latency" and "Bandwidth" were within an order of magnitude of pre-historic times.

## Three Step Changes

Then, around 200 years ago, the invention of the electric telegraph changed latency forever. What was previous limited to the speed of a man, horse, pigeon or train, now travelled at the speed of light.

The second step change came about 20 years ago, with the invention of the internet. "Bandwidth" and the volume of news was now almost infinite. But telecommunications were still expensive.

The third step change came a few years ago, with the rise of digital advertising. Suddenly, many people could transmit infinite amounts of data at the speed of light — for free — paid for by advertisers buying their attention and data.

## Nostalgia

We lament that ours is an era of #FakeNews and journalism that cares only about #ClickBait and #impressions. In reality, the issues is that the third step change has changed the world, and, driven by this change, news, media and journalism is having a crisis of identity.

Was news actually better 20 years ago? When a few governments and big organizations had a monopoly over its content? When the world of a few journalist was the word?

I'm not going to express an opinion on this — nor claim to be nostalgic. Instead, I'll pose a set of hypotheses:

1. News is a byproduct of its technological context. Each step change, changed that context, and with it News.

2. If we want to change news, we need to change the context

## Concluding Questions

Would any one of you agree to any of the following? I don't necessarily agree or disagree with any of them. They just happen to be interesting questions.

1. Would you go back to a world where news is controlled by a small number of governments and big organizations?

2. Would you go back to a world where either a) News has high latency, or b) News has low bandwidth, or c) Transmitting news is expensive?

3. What might a fourth step change be?

4. If news is going to be a victim of the third step change, what will its other victims be?
