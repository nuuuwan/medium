# Seeing through Randomness

### A thought experiment

(Disclaimer: We could repeat this experiment with a statistically significant audience. Unfortunately, I don't have the resources to do that. So, dear reader, take this, not as a "scientific experiment" but as a "thought experiment").

## Setup

This animated gif (Box World 1) consists of a grid of red and white boxes. A box could be red or white with an equal (50%) random probability. So any patterns you see are entirely random.

I generated a very similar grid (Box World 2). The generation method is identical to Box World 1, except for five boxes.

Four boxes (in shape of a cross) were white all the time. While the box in their centre changed colours at a constant frequency.

## Experiment 1

I asked a group of friends, "Each of the box worlds is either random or NOT random. Which of the following is true?"

* Both are random

* Only one is random

* Only two is random

* Neither is random

All claimed that both were Random.

## Experiment 2

I then revealed that Box World 2 was not random. But didn't show why. Instead, I encouraged my friends to explain why it was not Random.

Again no one was able to spot the cross. Instead, they came up with various theories. I noticed two patterns in the theories:

* The assumption that intervals of time that were different were the same. And hence, that boxes changed colour with constant frequency, when they didn't.

* Mistaking the colour of boxes.

The second pattern was a simple error. The first pattern was more interesting. It seemed that "time" was a bi-product of the pattern. Just as the pattern could be a bi-product of time.

## Conclusions

Based on my statistically insignificant thought experiment, I came to the following conclusions.

* Humans are bad at "seeing through" randomness.

* Humans see patterns where none exists.

* Humans don't have an absolute sense of time. Instead, time infers from changing patterns.
