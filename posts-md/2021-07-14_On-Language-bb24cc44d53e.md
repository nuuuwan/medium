# On Language

The world has two parts: a subjective world that we experience; and an objective world full of information. We cannot say, with certainty, that the latter exist, as we can only experience it through the former. But let's leave that for later.

What is relevant is experience, and how we communicate experience. Communication consists one sharing an experience with another. There is no guarantee that the experience communicated is identical, but there might be some validation that it is at least similar. When I tell you, "there is a cat on the mat", you might look at the mat and confirm, "yes — so there is.". There is no guarantee that what appears to me as a cat, does not appear to you as a dog or an abstract painting. But, at least, we have the same name for experiences that might be different.

This "naming" is the foundation of language. We communicate experiences through giving its various component forms, names; the "cat" and the "mat", for example. The "names" themselves are experiences. They exist only in terms of their sound (the sound of "cat"), what they look like (the shape of the letters that make up the word "cat"), and perhaps other experiences (like how the word "cat" might feel when embossed on wood).

In this way, language is a convention that translates experience to experience. A world where I tell you "there is a cat on the mat", is equivalent to a world where such is the case (assuming I am not lying and not mistaken).
