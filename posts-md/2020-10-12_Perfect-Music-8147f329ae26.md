# Perfect Music

The scent on its shiny surface,Black and white(an enchanting, yet tranquil dress).Through the window,its polished lid reflectsrestful shades that sieve(like a breeze sifting moonlight)a serene mosaic. Calm. It is drizzling.Softly.Like a quiet friend leaving you alone.And yet- not.Piano. Not quite winter.Still, autumn has retired.New rain.Syrupy, soft.Music. Sprinkling through the elmand the oak,the hornbeam and the London plane,Nestling snugly in the crisp, scented leavesAnd then leaping softlyPattering drops on Turtle pondAnd the old castle This, I don't see through the windowOnly in my mind's.Part of my world.Like the warm comfort of a soft blanket on a November morning A green, gentleness across Fifth Avenue.It wraps me. The fall is shut(like the mouth of a sleeping black swan).But drops of music pitter-patter on my mind.Not quite jazz.Not Reverie.La prélude belle petite?NonBut still perfect. Wanting nothing moreJust perfect
