### Contemplations

"Is there such a thing as past and future?" [I contemplate]

"Of course there is", [you say]. "We studied the past for history."

"And as to the future", [you continue]. "It must exist — because in the past, the "present" (which we know exists) was the future. So there."

But what is history? An honest study of the past, or nit-picking the present to unearth pieces of "evidence" that might support biased pronouncements about the past? And predictions about the future? Are they any more accurate than "predictions" about the past?

What I really want to say is this: For approximately 365 days, the "present" will be 2019. The past and the future are inaccurate at best. So I hope we all make the most of the only thing that is not past or future: The present.

Happy 2019!
