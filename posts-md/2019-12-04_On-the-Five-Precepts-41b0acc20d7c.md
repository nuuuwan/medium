# On the Five Precepts

### Are you a Buddhist?

Buddhists are expected to observe the Five Precepts (පන් සිල්). Or abstain from killing living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication.

Why?

## Commandments?

When I mentioned the Five Precepts to an Orthodox Jewish Friend, he at once drew a connection. "We also have commandments. Ten Commandments".

On the one hand, the Five Precepts are a type of "commandments". In fact, The fifth, sixth and seventh of the Ten Commandments of the Hebrew Bible, forbid murder, adultery and theft. Like the first, third and second precepts.

But on the other hand, the Five precepts are not commandments.

Firstly, they were not handed over by a divine being to a prophet on stone slabs on the top of a mountain. Secondly, there is no divine or heavenly reward for observing the Five Precepts.

You might argue that someone who keeps the Five Precepts acquires a lot of good Karma and hence should receive good things. But this too is not guaranteed. Karma is a complicated topic. Not some simple divine bank account.

## Social Code?

One could argue that individuals that observe precepts are beneficial to society. And I agree. A society where people don't murder, steal, commit adultery, lie, or take intoxicants would likely be peaceful.

But that is also not the point.

## Buddhist Training

Buddhists accept that existence is unsatisfactory. The cause of this unsatisfactoriness is craving.

When we "hate" something (say a mosquito perched on our arm), we "crave" a future where that thing (the mosquito) does not exist. We please craving by committing various unwholesome deeds (like swatting the mosquito). Committing these deeds reinforces our craving and future craving. A vicious cycle ensues.

Observing a precept like "abstain from killing living beings" puts some breaks on this cycle. This type of "break" is known as "higher virtue" (sila). Higher virtue is one of three types of "training" Buddhist should adopt. The other two being "higher mind" (citta) and "higher wisdom" (panna). Each "training" helps the other. For example, virtue helps the mind. And mind helps wisdom.

The cause of craving is ignorance. Identifying and understanding ignorance requires wisdom. Which in turn requires a developed mind. Which in turn requires virtue. The humble Five Precepts are the beginnings of this long process.

## Are you a Buddhist?

One acquires some "religions" by birth. If and only if one or both of your parents are of that religion, you are. Other religions by some ritual or purification process.

One acquires Buddhism through "training". Hence, if you're "born a Buddhist" or "perform all the processes and rituals", if you don't train yourself, you're not a Buddhist. The most basic form of training is observing the Five Precepts. If you don't keep the Five Precepts, you're not a Buddhist. Regardless of who your parents are or what else you do.

On the other hand, you might be a Buddhist even if you don't consider yourself one.

For example, if you observe an Abrahamic Faith (say Christianity, Islam or Judaism), you might already be keeping the Ten Hebrew Commandments. In which case, you are already "training" yourself in three of the five precepts. If you're a practising Muslim or a Pentecostal, you observe the fifth precept. You've already made some progress in "Buddhist Training", which makes you some kind of Buddhist.

On a personal note, I tend to like Sri Lankan parties with Muslim guests. Because I can mingle with them and not be forced to consume alcohol. Conversely, at 100% "Sinhala Buddhist" parties, the chances are that some "uncle" will try to force some booze down one's throat. We seem to have got the labels wrong.
