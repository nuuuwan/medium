# So close, yet so far

### What if they got a few more votes...

Many expected Sunil Handunnetti of the JJB to win a seat in Matara. In fact, he did come tantalizingly close. If the JJB won just 4,212 more votes in Matara, they would have won a seat. And SH might have been "in".

But there were other examples. The JBB itself came much closer to winning seats in Kalutara and Hambantota, than it did in Matara.

In this article, I list some "so close, yet so far" cases. Where with a few more votes, more seats would have been won.

[For clarity, I only look at cases with less than 10,000 votes, or 15% of what the votes the party actually won.]
