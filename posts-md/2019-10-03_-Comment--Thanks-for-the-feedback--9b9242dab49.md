[Comment]Thanks for the feedback!

RE: I wonder whether a map each for each of the two political parties color shaded for percent of votes received by each would give a better representation where PR matters for parliamentary elections.

Yes! It clearly would be a good representation. I've adopted part of this idea in my article on Presidential Elections (https://medium.com/on-politics/a-brief-history-of-sri-lankan-presidential-elections-8782c2dd8aac), where I use shading to represent winning margin in each polling division.

I'm hoping to write a similar article focussed on General Elections, where I can do what you recommend.
