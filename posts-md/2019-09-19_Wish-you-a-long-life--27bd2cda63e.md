# Wish you a long life!

### On different forms of greeting

ආයුබෝවන්!

In Sinhala (my native tongue), we formally greet people with the phrase ආයුබෝවන් (pronounced, āyubōvan), meaning "wish you a long life".

I was curious about how various peoples around the world greet each other, did a quick web search, and found this site which lists formal greetings in 50 languages.

Almost all greetings seem to fall into one of six groups:

* Good day (or variations like, Good Morning, Good Afternoon etc) [17/50]

* How are you? (how, hello, hi) [13/50]

* Good Health (be well, long life) [7/50]

* God (god is good, god be with you) [4/50]

* Homage [4/50]

* Peace [3/50]

Others ("I see you" in Zulu, and "East", referring to the morning sun, in Tsonga) [2/50]

I wonder why different people chose these different greetings. It might indicate differences in what people consider most important (e.g. empathy, concern, health, God, respect, peace).

On the other hand, while ආයුබෝවන් (in the "Good Health" group) is the dominant formal greeting in Sinhala, we do have other greetings which fall into some of the other groups too.

* සුබ දවසක් (Good Day)

* කොහොමද? (How?)

* දෙවි පිහිටයි (God bless you), or the Buddhist equivalent බුදු සරණයි ( May you take refuge in the Buddha)

So, I suppose different people are not that different?

ආයුබෝවන්!
