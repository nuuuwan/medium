# On Questions

### Questions startups should be asking

## The most important question

Most startups fail; a few have a small chance of succeeding. But most fail.

For the few that might succeed, most paths to the future will end in failure; less than a handful will result in success.

Hence, there is one question all startups should always be asking: Are we on a path to success? Or simply,

>>> "Are we going to succeed?"

This question can, equivalently, be framed probabilistically,

>>> "What are our chances of succeeding?"

And negatively:

>>> "Are we going to fail?"

Personally, I like the negative-probabilistic framing:

>>> "What are our chances of failing?"

## The next most important questions

"What are our chances of failing?" is, while important, abstract, bordering on philosophical.

Our next task is to break it down into sub-questions which will help put a "number" (however, approximate or qualitative) on the probability. Hence, the next questions are:

>>> "What does failing actually mean?"

>>> "What are all the ways in which we can fail?"

>>> "What are the chances of this type of failure happening?"

>>> "What can we do to prevent that sort of failure?"

For example, "failing" means running out of money. One way we can fail is "We don't get X customers by date Y". We won't hit this goal if we don't do A, B, and C. Hence, we should do A, B and C. (Repeated for all the other ways of failing).

## Nothing else matters

The next most important question is:

>>> "What are the things we are doing that have nothing to do with the most important question?"

If there are things that seem to be disconnected from the most important question, they are actually connected. Anything else, is a distraction. And hence, will contribute to failure.

Hence, stop doing everything that doesn't matter.
