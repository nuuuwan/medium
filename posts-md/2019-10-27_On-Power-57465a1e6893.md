# On Power

### A Sri Lankan Citizen's wishlist

In a representative democracy, citizens elect various representatives to help meet various needs that the state is expected to meet. From defence to finance to foreign affairs. This delegation involves a transfer of power. From citizen to representative. For example, when citizens elect a president or an MP, they implicitly endow that representative with power. Immense amounts of power.

I'm a Sri Lankan citizen. And I'm not (entirely) happy with how power works in our democracy. Things can improve.

And that is what this article is about.

## Delegatability of Power

I live in the Colombo Electoral District, which has over 1.5 million registered voters, and elects 19 MPs to parliament.

If you want to enter parliament from Colombo, you need to compete for 1.5 million people. Against dozens of other candidates.

This demands a considerable investment, probably 100s of millions of rupees. This is not only a massive barrier for most potential candidates, but it also induces many to seek favours from undesirable sources. Favours that demand return.

It is also a problem for the voters. Of the 19 Colombo MPs, I have probably seen five or six in person. That too speaking at various public forums, where the audience is anonymous. Perhaps none of them has ever heard of me or knows my views or needs.

Hence, we have a bunch of "representatives" with no connection to the people they "represent". The process by which citizens delegate power to representatives is completely broken.

At the core if this problem is a blind proportional representation system. While it has some advantages, we blindly ignore its many disadvantages. We should replace blind proportional representation with an alternative, which makes power more delegatable.

## Controllability of Power

There is an unhealthy connection between our legislature and executive. While MPs are nominally elected to the legislature, in reality, they aspire to high posts in the executive. Cabinet ministerships in top ministries. Often the Executive presidency itself.

Citizens have no control over who gets appointed to these high posts. Like the Minister of Defence, Finance, or Foreign Affairs.

Sometimes, high positions go to senior members of the party, or those who get the most number of votes. This criteria, while not ideal, at least, has some degree of transparency and rationale.

However, too often, high positions go to shady dealers who hold the right cards in power-politics. People in power owe these powerful people powerful favours. The ordinary citizen has no visibility into this dark and undemocratic world.

Hence, there should be a clean break between legislature and executive. Legislators should be restricted to legislating. Experts should execute.

## Suitability of Power

The majority of workers in state ministries and departments are (at least officially) non-political. They are chosen for their professional skills, and many rise through the ranks. The private sector also has qualified experts and technocrats.

The most qualified of these people should lead their respective executive areas. We should have experts in defence lead defence, have experts in finance and economics lead finance, and have experts in diplomacy and international relations lead foreign affairs. Why should an MP with no O-Levels, lead a high office of state?

Just as they make laws, legislators could take part in appointing these executive officials. They could also draft laws that ensure that the executives have the correct qualifications. For example, the executive in charge of finance should have doctoral qualifications in finance or economics and a distinguished record. The law should ensure this.

Making the executive more independent of the legislature, would also "free" legislators to do their jobs better. MPs could focus on understanding their voters needs better and translating them into laws, which the executive can act upon. Instead of worrying about what exchange rates should be.

## Proportionality of Power

Power should be proportional to the job at hand. There is some amount of power an MP needs to do his job. Or some amount of power that a minister of finance needs to do her job. The power concentrated in a single position should not exceed its remit. The separation of legislature and executive indirectly satisfies this need for proportionality.

Power should also be proportional to the human wielding it. However important the job, no human should be given too much power. Since "absolute power corrupts absolutely". Hence, positions with disproportionate power, like that of a quasi-Autocratic Executive President, should be abolished.

## Concluding reflections

There are many reasons why my suggestions would not be practical. The most important is that many powerful people would lose their power. And many people who depend on these powerful people would also loose out. To various degrees.

So how can we implement these ideas? I don't have a good answer. A first step would probably consist of building a power-base of MPs, who agree with this philosophy. And then slowly grow that base.

In parallel, citizens would also need convincing. But I'm sceptical how top-of-mind governance reform is for most people. Too many people have better things to worry about. You don't worry about "checks-and-balances" if you're busy worrying about where your child's next meal cheque comes from.

Also, through all of this, I tacitly assume that a democratic system of government is best for Sri Lanka. Too many Sri Lankans would disagree. Many seem to want a "benevolent dictator" or even a king. And there are not unreasonable reasons for this.

Again, I don't have a good answer. Maybe asking Sri Lanka to be democratic is like expecting an infant boy to be a man. Perhaps we are too immature right now. I also have my reservations about democracy, which I've elaborated in On Democracy.

Eitherway, while I might not be the strongest believer in Democracy, I do want the best for Sri Lanka. And it seems like the way power works (at the moment) is not in Sri Lanka's best interests. That's why we need a change.
