# Random events around Colombo

Whiffs of water droplets, Splashing on leaves, Warmed by a mid-afternoon of sunshine, A grandfather tending plants in a quaint little garden,Adorned by shadows of dark green.A young couple amble into a Kottu place,

Greeted by its own percussive beacon,("A tempo" is my stride)An avocado-white vine with lavish verdures, It sashays up a jac-fruit tree,A sari draped across a sultry, sandalwood torso. Windows with sunburned, mahogany edges, Peeking out of whitened fences. Recently clipped grass, sumptuous and fragrant.A sea relaxing behind a craggy skyline.The crispy-sweet, scent of fresh hoppers.A sun (not quite set), Sleepy crows hovering across it.Ancient buildings serious, noble and dignified, Keeping guard, uninterrupted for 150 years,Witness more than just a few Random events around Colombo.
