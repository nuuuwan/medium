# On Tiredness

### Some reflections on justice and vulnerability

## Washing Dishes and Traffic Lights

Late last night I was washing dishes. I was tired and wanted to sleep. As I placed one last spoon on the dish rack, the damn thing fell off its perch and slid into some unreachable nook.

I almost heard myself mentally scream, "Why?!"

It's not just dishes.

Traffic lights always pick on me when I'm tired. There's not one car at right angles, but it insists on taking a vacation in the red.

But it's not just trivial things like spoons and traffic lights.

Even larger injustices seem to befall me when I'm tired. Bad things happen at work when I'm tired. Even my best friends turn into bad people when I'm tired.

Even the big world outside my little life seems to team with injustice when I'm tired. Children die of disease when I'm tired. Terrorists plant bombs when I'm tired. Wicked politicians get elected when I'm tired.

What's going on? How come my tiredness is all-powerful? How come all these injustices happen when I'm tired?

## A Theory of Injustice

Justice is some expectation that the world past, present and future abide by some rules. We believe that these rules to be "right", and we also expect these rules to be "enforced".

Conversely, we feel "injustice" if A) we believe in rules that are "right"; and B) these rules are not enforced. Someone or something breaks the rules.

Why is it, when I'm tired, the world is full of injustice? I don't quite know. But I have this theory:

When I'm tired, I'm also vulnerable. When we are weak, we look around for anything or anyone that will aide our survival. "Rules" are some of the first things we "anchor" on, because they are some of the few "certainties" in an otherwise uncertain world. When we are vulnerable, we want the rules to work. We want justice.

And when the rules don't work, as is common in an uncertain world, our sense of justice vents.

Conversely, when I'm not tired, I don't feel as vulnerable.

I'm more open and understanding of the uncertainties of the world. I know that spoons sometimes wall off, and traffic lights turn red. That things don't always go according to plan at work, and my friends face problems and difficulties from time to time. Even children die of disease, and people commit acts of terrorism. All of these, sometimes for reasons that I don't understand.

That's my theory.

## Caveats and Purpose

Now, I don't mean that we shouldn't try to fix problems. It's more about understanding that problems are normal. And that we shouldn't let it affect us too much. Also, that we should understand ourselves, we are likely to be more vulnerable at some times as opposed to others.

Especially when we are tired.
