# Why Government?

### Reflections on Budgets and Values

This chart shows how our government budgets expenditure.

I was curious. Were these numbers too high or too low? Was all this spending necessary?

It was challenging to get one's head around numbers like 300,000,000,000 (our annual spending on Defence). A zero here or there didn't seem to make much of a difference. So I decided to make two adjustments.

* First, "convert" the numbers to "per person".

* Second, to align things with how most "ordinary" people "budget", convert the numbers to "per month".

Assuming a population of 22,000,000, we get defence spending at Rs. 13,636 per person per year, or about Rs. 1,200 per person per month. Similarly,

This led to more questions. For example, would I be willing to forgo all the services that the Ministry of Health provided in exchange for Rs. 700 a month? Or stop using transport and highways for Rs. 910?

Was the government doing a good job, or could I pay someone else less and get more value for my money?

Pondering these questions, led to more questions on the "purpose of government".

## Big Government, Small Government

Almost everyone agrees that a country needs a government. But Many disagree, on its nature and size.

At one extreme, Libertarians argue for "Small Government". Where governments are responsible for as little expenditure as possible. At the other extreme, Communists argue for "Big Government". Where all spending is centrally planned and controlled.

Neither extreme seemed idea, so I thought of reasoning about each type of spending. One by one.

## Defence (Rs. 1,200 per month)

Like all things military, Defence is a hierarchical topic. A president of a country is usually also commander-in-chief. Unlike health, finance, or education, Defence is proportional to the size of a nation. A smaller state can be healthier, wealthier and wiser, than a bigger country. But a bigger country is almost always "stronger". Defence-wise.

Hence, in most cases, Defence is centralised. Centralisation is partly due to the need for control. It would be "inconvenient" if the governor of each province had to approve a country's military action. It is also due to some "centralised values". For example, protecting the "sovereignty" of a country is a goal of its defence forces. And sometimes "sovereignty" and decentralisation (e.g. "Federalism") conflict.

Thus, it would be almost impossible to think of Sri Lanka's military organised at a provincial level.

On the other hand, a few countries, like Switzerland, have a relatively decentralised defence system. Cantons have significant powers, especially with important decisions like declaring war. I wonder if more countries had decentralised defence systems, whether there would be fewer wars?

## Health (Rs. 700) and Education (Rs. 700)

Unlike Defence, health and education can be decentralised. There are many private hospitals and schools in the country. However, these are mostly patronised by the wealthy. The majority relies on the state for free healthcare and education.

In theory, the central government could decentralise health and education entirely to local governments. And restrict itself, not to execution, but to only legislation.

In practice, it seems that the government performs a balancing act. Colombo and Moneragala could, in theory, run all their hospitals and schools. But in practice, Colombo has more resources than Moneragala, and hence could probably provide better services. By transferring resources from more affluent areas to poorer ones, the government ensures that everyone has some basic level of healthcare.

The principle or "value" behind this balancing seems to be "All Sri Lankans have the right to some level of healthcare and education". Whether Colombo or Moneragala.

But suppose you are a wealthy person. You can afford private hospitals and schools. Perhaps even international ones. Would you forgo government health and educational services? For Rs. 1,400 per month?

You might want your money back. But it isn't that simple. You benefit indirectly in many other ways. For example, you might employ people who benefit from state education and healthcare. And if the government doesn't ask your neighbour to clear his drains, you might suffer Dengue.

## Highways (Rs. 660) and Transport (Rs. 250)

Most roads are maintained by local authorities, like municipal councils, urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas. If you live on a private road, it's you and your neighbours who do the maintaining.

But what about large projects? Like expressways, new railway systems, and airports?

Highway and Transport Infrastructure and "infrastructure" in general, suffer from a paradox. "Infrastructure" almost always makes a loss in the short-term. Even in the longer-term, it usually makes a "measurable" loss. On the other hand, many believe that its "un-measurable" benefits out-weigh these "measurable" costs. For example, building and maintaining an expressway might cost a government billions. But it might also spur commerce and industry in locations accessible by the highway. And increase the country's productivity as a whole.

## Concluding Questions

I still don't know if I'm paying too much or too little for Defence, health, education, transport, highways, and manifest other things. But I'll continue asking myself the following questions:

* Why does the government provide some service? What values lie behind their various roles?

* Is the government the best party to provide that service?

* If not, who should?

* If so, how might the government do better?
