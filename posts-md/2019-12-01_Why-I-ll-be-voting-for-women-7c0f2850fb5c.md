### The Gotabaya Rajapaksa Cabinet

# Why I'll be voting for women

You might have seen some memes complaining about the gender and ethnic composition of the new Gotabaya Rajapaksa Cabinet. Particularly, that there was only one woman, and no Moor members.

I pulled some numbers from Wikipedia, to analyze this complaint.

## Women

51% of Sri Lankans are female. If parliament reflected this ratio, we would have 115 female MPs. Instead, we have only 12.

While some parties appear to have a few more women tha others, the differences are not statistically signifcant. All parties do an abysmal job at attracting women members.

The single woman in the Cabinet merely reflects this overall shortage.

Even having zero women of the 38 state and deputy ministers is not "unfair" given that there are only 12 to start with. If we randomly assign members to batches of 38, about 10% will not include any women. Hence, we can't conclude at a 10% significance level that the 38 is "unfair to women — given the composition of parliament".

## Minorities

If parliament reflected proportions of Sinhala, Tamil and Moor ethnicities in Sri Lanka, we would have 169, 35 and 21 Sinhala, Tamil and Moor MPs respectively. The actual numbers are not very different, with slightly more Sinhala MPs, fewer Tamil MPs. Ratios across parties, on the other hand, vary significantly.

What about the claim that having no Moor MPs in the cabinet is unfair? Since UPFA has only three Moor MPs to start with, again we can't conclude that "Moors have been treated unfairly".

Of course, there is the question of why the UPFA has fewer Tamils and Moors to start with. But that is a different question. Cabinets and ministers are picked out of the pool of MPs.

## Vote for Women

Ethnicity and religion dominates Sri Lankan politics. While there is discrimination, and inequity along these lines, these problems are small compared to those along gender lines. As in most walks of life, women are the true "persecuted majority".

During the next general election (which will likely be in March or April 2020), I'm going to cast my preference to a female candidate. My choice is not based on "positive discrimination" or "affirmative action", but because I'm confident that there will be strong and capable female candidates representing the Colombo Electoral District (my district), and others.

Too many voters vote for men because they believe "woman make poor politicians" or because "politics is a man's job". In other words, most voters actually "positively discrimate" towards men. The end result is that we end-up electing a bunch of nitwits and criminals to parliament. Let's not make this eternal mistake yet again.

Happy voting!
