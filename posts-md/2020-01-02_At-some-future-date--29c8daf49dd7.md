# At some future date...

### Ode to a City

At some future date,

when I'm older, wiser, and content,

I will, by chance, visit a city.

A city I once lived in long ago.

A city I once loved.

I will expect nothing.

I will be infinitely happy.

Afterall, it is when one expects nothing that one has infinite happiness.

I will sit on a bench in a park, or by a lake, or a canal.

Watching the water sparkle.

Feeling the wind in my eyes.

Breathing in the grass and the mist.

I will think: Peace.

Nothing can be more perfect.

But I will have spoken too soon.

For you will have sat next to me.

And as I watch the water, and breath the mist.

With the same breath, you would be watching the water, and breathing the mist.

And at that moment,

I will turn my head, as you turn yours.

I will look into your eyes.

And you gaze into mine.

At some future date...
