### 7 Philosophical Conjectures

In his fascinating book, The Order of Time [2], physicist Carlo Rovelli discusses how most of physics is independent of an "order" of time (i.e. a differentiation of past, present and future). While he describes entropy as an exception (entropy can only increase as time passes), he goes on to point out that entropy is a relatively arbitrary concept, that vanishes at quantum levels.

Inspired by this book, I wanted to share some of my own speculations about time, and particularly its relationship with information.

### Conjecture 1: The Relationship between time and information

The present is the past with the addition of some new information.

For example, suppose one tosses a fair coin. After the coin is tossed, one bit of new information (namely "which way the coin landed"), is added to the universe.

Symbolically,

Aristotle described time as a passing of events, that the difference between the past and present was that the present had witnessed more events, and that, independent of events, time was meaningless. There is an interesting parallel in making time dependent on events, and on information. Isaac Newton, on the other hand, described time as an absolute, that passes independent of events. This latter view has dominated physics, until recently when Rovelli and others have started questioning the elite status of time.

### Conjecture 2: Approximating the Future

While we cannot know for sure what the future will be like, we use all manner of models and theories to try and predict the future, using information available in the present. Hence, any expectation of future information is a function of present information, and this expectation is an approximation.

Hence,

### Conjecture 3: Approximating the Past

Now, if we replace "future" with "past" in Conjecture 2, all the reasoning and conclusions still hold. You might ask, "But we know what the past is (unlike the future), so why do we need to approximate it?"

The fact is, we don't know anything exact about the past. Just like the future, we approximate based on memories, records, and other forms of media. These might appear to be more "accurate" than models of the future, but they are still approximate, and based on the present, not the past.

For example, an archaeologist might speculate about how ancient humans lived 30,000 years ago based on skeletal remains, but these speculations are approximations based on the present (a bunch of bones), and nothing else.

So, similarly,

### Conjecture 4: On the Exclusivity of the Present

Can we know any information about the past or future or any time that is not the present, which is not an approximation dependent on present information? What if we cannot?

If we cannot,

### Conjecture 5: Time as a memory aide

Even if we accept that we can no no information, but that which is in the present, we all have a vert strong sense of time. For example, we care hopeful or anxious about the future, as we might be content or remorseful about the past. So even if time is imaginary, or a construction of our minds, it clearly feels real.

Why? What is the point of time?

Let's start with why our notion of time might be useful for survival, for if this were the case, it might exist because it has evolved as a survival advantage.

When we talk about "the past", what do we actually mean? To me, "the past" is a collection of facts, feelings and thoughts which are consistent with some past event.

For example, I accept that I was vaccinated for measles as a infant. This "acceptation" is based on several facts, including a small scar on my left arm, and another memory of an entry ("measles vaccination") in my immunisation record. There are also many details I have forgotten — like what the immunologist looked like, whether the immunologist had other staff assisting, and which one of my parents accompanied me.

The past event of "getting a measles vaccine" conveniently prioritises relevant details, and excludes all the rest. The most useful detail of this past is "Have I or have I not got a measles vaccine?" and thanks to the "past" I'm able to confidently answer this question. Correctly.

[Almost. Actually, not quite. The vaccination was actually not for measles, but for BCG — but until a few weeks ago, when I re-inspected my immunisation record, I was firmly convinced that it was measles. Even the rock solid past can be made fragile by information in the present]

### Conjecture 6: Past and Future are meaningless [Corollary of Conjecture 4]

"But it's not just about scars and records, is it" you say. "You really did get a vaccine in the past, didn't you?"

Maybe — but we'll never know. There is information in the present that might be framed as "evidence" for the past. But that's all we can say.

The same applies for the future.

### Conjecture 7: Time durations are meaningless [Corollary of Conjecture 6]

Given that past, future, and points of time that are not the present have no meaning, we can't talk about durations.

For example, if you leave Colombo at 6am, and reach Galle for breakfast at 8am, you might say that your journey had a duration of 2 hours. However, this concept of duration and the 2 hours is, like time, another aide to memory. The present might have "evidence" that is consistent with the duration of time, but, again, that is all we can say.

With durations loosing meaning, any concept of "persistent time" is also meaningless.
