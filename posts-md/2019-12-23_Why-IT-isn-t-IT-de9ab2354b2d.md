# Why IT isn't IT

### From Typists to Email

## Typists and "Old IT"

There was a time when nobody in the company typed.

If you were a junior employee, you would prepare your letter in writing and give it to a pool of secretaries. You would get your typed-letter a few days later. If you were lucky.

If you were a boss, you had the privilege of a personal secretary. Usually pretty. Who, among other things, took dictation. You would read-out your letter, and she would note it in short-hand. Then she'd type it out. You would read the typed-draft and suggest some corrections. After a few iterations, by the end of the day, the letter would get sent. Another boss in another department or company would go through the same process to send you a reply. A few weeks later.

"Old IT" in the old days, used to be like typing. Like the "typing pool", the "IT Department" was vertical. And as typist did all the typing, all IT had to go through the "IT guys".

Typists provided a particular service. Translate verbal or hand-written communication into printed communication, usually in a standard format. Similarly, IT Departments also provided a very standard and templated service. You had the choice of a small set of hardware and software. Which satisfied a small set of needs. Hence, IT Departments across different organisations (say Banking, Tourism, or Retail) were almost identical. Just as their typing pools were.

"IT guys" had very specific skills. Juniors were responsible for maintenance and troubleshooting. Seniors were responsible for procurement and tenders. The old IT department never developed any software. Everything outsourced to 3rd party vendors. Like the IT Department, these vendors were also generic. And knew little about the organisation.

## Email and "New IT"

These days (almost) all professionals can type. Due to word processing software and email. This "universal typing trend" made the traditional typist almost obsolete. And also transformed communication in the organisation.

What was a niche skill concentrated in a vertical (the typing pool), became horizontal. Everyone could type. Typed communication was no longer restricted to a small set of "important letters". But to any communication. Communication cycles that used to take several days now took seconds.

"New IT" is like email.

IT is no longer restricted to a small set of standard and templated services provided by third-party vendors. Just like you can send anything in an email, a modern IT department can satisfy (almost) any organisational need. An increasing portion of an organisation's value and competitive advantage concentrates in its digital data and IT development.

Just as anyone can write email, the modern IT department is, not a vertical, but a horizontal. Often embedded in each part of the company, satisfying specific needs. Since templated, off-the-shelf software cannot be used for solving particular problems, companies build their own software for their individual needs.

The modern IT department has very different people. While old IT seniors did procurement and tenders, new bosses architect systems and try to predict the future needs and trends of the company. IT juniors build those systems, and understand the organisation.

## Achala's Depression

When I met Achala a couple of weeks ago, he was depressed. There was so much to do, but no one was allowed to do anything. Could I advise him whether he should stay? Or leave and work on something more interesting?

Achala (not their real name) had graduated from Moratuwa two years ago. With a first-class degree in Computer Engineering, and a top-10 GPA. He then joined one of Sri Lanka's largest companies. One with tens of thousands of employees and several subsidiaries.

I asked him why no one was allowed to do anything. "It's the CTO", he said. Everything remotely IT related that the company does, had to be approved by the CTO. And the CTO blocked everything.

This seemed bizarre to me. It was like having every single email in the large company having to be typed by a single secretary. Who refused to type anything.

I did a quick LinkedIn search for the CTOs. I couldn't locate his university but seemed to be somewhere in England. The degree had the words "management", "administration" and "technology". But no "engineering" or "science" or "development".

Achala wanted to build a system that would make the organisation's logistics systems more efficient. A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation indicated a saving of millions of rupees every month. However, the Typist CTO had blocked the idea, claiming that they were just about to buy some software from the US (costing millions of dollars) that would (apperently) do the same thing.

I am somewhat familiar with this software, and I don't know how a standard "relational database" might optimise transport logistics in Sri Lanka.

## Concluding Reflections

I've spoken to several CEO of large Sri Lankan companies, and almost all understand and want to adopt "Modern IT". But paradoxically, virtually all these organisations are bogged down with "Old IT".

The top reason for this paradox is a rotten middle-management of Typist-CTO-types. Who depend on the old regime for their careers. They no nothing but Old IT. And hence, flog companies with third-rate, irrelevant systems from abroad, costing millions. Of dollars.

Instead, Sri Lankan organisations should be building their own software. If a random vendor of generic software, located thousands of miles away, knows more about your business than you, you should probably get out of that business. It's only a matter of time before someone kicks you out.

Oddly, some public organisations (e.g. government departments, state universities), seem to be well ahead of private ones, in this respect. They are quickly realising how obsolete outsourcing software is. And hence, they are building their software and development arms.

Hope the private sector follows suit.
