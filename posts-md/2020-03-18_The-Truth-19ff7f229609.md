# The Truth

### Why "the truth is rarely pure and never simple"

## The Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth

Suppose I toss a coin. The question "what was the result?" has exactly two answers: "heads" or "tails". You can give the correct answer if you saw the coin fall; or if a truthful person informs you that they saw the fall; and what the result was. In this matter, the truth is simple. A simple binary.

Now suppose that I tossed a coin a 1000 times. Collectively, the result has two to the power 1000 possibilities; a decimal number with over 300 digits. Suppose I ask you the same question as before: "what was the result?"

The "Whole Truth" will be a list of 1000 "sub-results"; each being a head or a tail. If all 1000 sub-results are correct, your answer would be "Nothing but the Truth". If you miss any of the results (say, if you only report the last 500 results), your answer would be "Nothing but the Truth", but not the "Whole Truth". If you report all the results, but only the last 500 are correct, it would be neither.

## Arguments

Suppose Alice (like you), reports all the results, but only the last 500 are correct. Bob, also reports all the results, but in his case, only the first 500 are correct. Both Alice and Bob are "half-right" and "half-wrong". At the same time, the disagree on all 1000 results. They agree on nothing.

If the have a conversation about the results, it is likely to turn into an "argument" that can't resolve.

## Complexity

We can explain the result of a coin toss, or even 1000 coin tosses, or even a billion coin tosses, with precision and accuracy. But such an explanation is not possible for most real world phenomena.

Consider the statement: "Capitalism is better that Socialism" (or the reverse, if you wish it). Verifying this statement would involve analysing and understanding billions of data points. A "Capitalist" is someone who believes that most of the data points are consistent with the statement. A "fanatically, fundamentalist capitalist" might believe that *all* the data points are consistent. Similarly, a socialist would believe the opposite.

All but fanatics, both Capitalists and Socialists would accept that some data points support the opposite view. Often, the "Truth" is somewhere in the middle.

## Unknowns and Unknowable Unknowns

As complexity increases, the data points needed to verify statements also increases. Many of these data points would remain unanalyzed and unknown. Hence, some data points would support "Capitalism is better that Socialism", some would refute it, and many would remain unknown.

A particular variation of the "Unknown" is randomness; data points with changing values. A piece of evidence that supports one view at one time, and another at another. Unlike the "Unknown" in general, that might become "Knowable" future time, randomness consists of "Unknowable Unknowns".

Randomness is not the only "Unknowable Unknown". For example, Kurt Godel proved that certain mathematical statemens are true, yet, we cannot prove them true.

## Best Practices

* It is best not to have "strong views". Best to say "I don't know", "Yes and No", and "On the other hand".

* It is best not to pronounce simple answers to complex questions. To "Is Capitalism is better that Socialism?", only a fool would answer "Capitalism" or "Socialism".

* It is best to ask questions. Especially clarifying questions. "Is Capitalism is better that Socialism? How would you define better? What is Capitalism? What is Socialism?"

* It is best to try and hold the opposite view. While the opposite of a true statement must be a false statement, the opposite of a partially true statement, can also be partially true. All statements about complex phenomena are partially true; and hence so are their opposites. Hence, "Capitalism is better that Socialism" and "Socialism is better that Capitalism" can both be true.

* It is best not to adopt labels. Anyone who calls themselves a "Capitalist" or a "Socialist" (for example), might as well call themselves "Idiot"; or more completely "I am incapable of seeing complex phenomena as complex phenomena". The same applies to Religion and Politics.

* It is best not to describe others as labels. Anyone who says "Ah, he's a Capitalist Pig" (say), might as well say "I'm an Idiot"; or more completely, "I'm incapabale of understanding people at none but the most trivial level of sophistication".

* It is best not to dismiss any statement as inane. If someone says "You are a Capitalist Pig", while that might reveal the said someone's weaknesses, it might also say something true about you. "You" are a complex phenomena; and all statements about complex phenonema are partially true.

* It is best to look outwards for common ground. Many partially true views have no "inner" common ground (e.g. Alice and Bob). In mathematical terms, "the set intersection is empty". Instead, it is best to understand what is true in what the other says. This leads to an expansion of truth to the outer common ground, instead of a reduction to the inner common ground. In math words, "the set union is bigger than any of its components". For example, a "Pro Lifer" would not be able to accept "Pro Choice", and vice-versa. But both might be able to accept "Life is sacred" and "Women should be able to control their bodies".

* It is best to give people a chance. Most people label people of the opposing view with that label. Hence, "Charlie is a Capitalist" and "Sally is a Socialist". One's prejudice for the label clouds one's view of others. Give-up the labels and clouds clear.
