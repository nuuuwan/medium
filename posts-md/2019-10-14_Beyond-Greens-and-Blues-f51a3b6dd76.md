# Beyond Greens and Blues

### TODOs for third parties

Imagine you support a third-party candidate in the upcoming 2019 Sri Lankan presidential elections. Now, imagine you read my article On Floating Voters, where I say:

>>> "With the Blue and Green voter bases at 44% and 39%, the remaining 17% is the floating vote."

And conclude:

>>> "All we can say is that the blues will (probably) win at least 44% of the vote, while the Greens will win at least 39% of the vote."

What should you do? Give-up in despair? Emigrate to some lonely western country? Or curl up into a ball like Prince Dutugemunu? If the Greens and the Blues will get 39% + 44% of the vote, how can a third party possibly win?

Actually, giving-up might be premature. In this article, I try and explain why.

## 1. Prove the statistics wrong

Statistics rely on many assumptions. One crucial assumption is that "the future will be like the past". While this assumption is reasonable, from time to time, there are "Black Swans": A future event that is nothing like any past event.

Historically, two parties have dominated French Politics: The Center-Left Socialist Party, and the Gaullist, Center-Right Union for the New Republic, or one of its incarnations. In 2017, Emmanuel Macron won the French Presidency, with a completely new party La République En Marche, beating candidates from both left and right. Not only did Macron win the presidency, En Marche went on to win the French Parliament soon after, in a General Election.

Macron was a Black Swan. And Black Swans prove statistics "wrong" all the time. I use inverted commas because it is not precisely statistics that is wrong, but the "the future will be like the past" assumption.

"Green or Blues will always win because the future will be like the past" is also an assumption. An assumption that any third party worth its salt should try and prove wrong in the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election.

## 2. Break the base

A candidate needs 50% plus one vote to win a presidential election. With a floating vote of only 17%, to win, a third party would have to "break into" a significant part of voter bases of the Greens and the Blues.

But wait! Isn't it impossible to break into the base vote? Don't people in the base, by definition, not vote for other parties?

Not quite.

The concept of a "base vote" is approximate and relative. Even the most stubborn voters change their mind. And also if they don't, all voters eventually, die. So the "voting base" of any party is continuously changing — slowly but still changing.

However, to break the base, a third candidate would need to do something truly extraordinary; something that will energise, inspire and rally the electorate. Sadly, thus far, I haven't seen anything like that. But that doesn't mean it won't happen before November 16th.

## 3. Make a start

I don't realistically believe that a third party candidate could win this presidential election. However, I do believe that this presidential election could be the first step of something much bigger for a third party.

For example, let's suppose a third party wins 15% of the vote. Let's say by winning most of the floating vote, and some non-trivial proportion of the voter bases of the main parties. Now, this would be a massive achievement for the said third party, and no easy feat.

But that won't be the end.

In Sri Lanka, Presidential Elections and General (Parliamentary) elections go hand in glove. A good performance in one implies a good performance in the other. Whichever party that wins next monthhas a good chance of winning the next General election. And our next General Election must happen before December 2020.

If our hypothetical third-party replicates their 15% share in a general election, they should get over 30 seats. Any party with 30 seats has a significant influence in parliament. It could be the start of something substantial and meaningful.

The odds are steep, but not impossible.

## Epilogue — Respect to the undecided

I haven't decided how to vote. Like many people in the country, I might end up voting for the Green or Blue candidate. Or I might vote for a third party. Either way, as of writing, I am undecided.

To "decide" we have to think. While we are "undecided", we are thinking. And once we "decide" we stop thinking.

If my piece On Floating Voters said one thing, it is that about 44% + 39% of Sri Lankan Voters had already decided. Many of them probably had their genes, circumstances, ethnicity or religion decide on their behalf. And after that, they stopped thinking. Many of them decided before they were born. Many of them, before they reached voting age.

Maybe its time to undecide. And start thinking again.
