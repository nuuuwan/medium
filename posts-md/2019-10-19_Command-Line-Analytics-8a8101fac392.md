### Analysing Election Results like aÂ boss

Recently, I've written a couple of articles analysing Sri Lankan Presidential Elections, including: Election Projections, Bellwether Polling Divisions, On Floating Voters and A Brief History of Sri Lankan Presidential Elections.

All these analyses are based on data I scraped from the Election Commission Website. I have shared this data in JSON and CSV format on GitHub.

In this article, I share a couple simple commands you can use to answer some interesting questions about elections.

I use data from presidential_election_results.denorm.csv, which is a table of all the results in our seven Presidential Elections.

## Basic Commands

To see all the data, run

```
cat presidential_election_results.denorm.csv
```

This will print out all the lines in the file:

```
year,result_code,electoral_district_name,polling_division_name,party,candidate,votes,percentage,affiliation
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,UNP,Junius Richard Jayewardene,29380,69.03,green
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,SLFP,Hector Kobbekaduwa,10641,25.0,blue
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,JVP,Rohana Wijeweera,1645,3.86,red
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,LSSP,Colvin Reginald de Silva,361,0.85,red
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,ACTC,Kumar Ponnambalam,477,1.12,yellow
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,NSSP,Vasudeva Nanayakkara,60,0.14,red
```

```
1988,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,UNP,Ranasinghe Premadasa,22389,63.26,green
```

```
1988,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,SLFP,Sirimavo Bandaranaike,10744,30.36,blue
```

```
1988,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,SLPP,Oswin Abeygunasekara,2259,6.38,purple
```

```
...
```

To see the field headings, you can run:

```
head -n 1 presidential_election_results.denorm.csv
```

Giving,

```
year,result_code,electoral_district_name,polling_division_name,party,candidate,votes,percentage,affiliation
```

To see the field headings and first line, run:

```
head -n 2 presidential_election_results.denorm.csv
```

```
year,result_code,electoral_district_name,polling_division_name,party,candidate,votes,percentage,affiliation
```

```
1982,01A,Colombo,Colombo North,UNP,Junius Richard Jayewardene,29380,69.03,green
```

This means that in 1982, Junius Richard Jayewardene of the UNP (green) got 29,380 votes (a percentge of 69.03%) in the Colombo North polling divisions, which is part of the Colombo electoral district, and has result code 01A.

You can format this output a bit better by replacing the commas with tabs:

```
head -n 2 presidential_election_results.denorm.csv | tr , â€˜\t'
```

```
year result_code electoral_district_name polling_division_name party candidate votes percentage affiliation
```

```
1982 01A Colombo Colombo North UNP Junius Richard Jayewardene 29380 69.03 green
```

If you want to see only a few fiels, say 5) Party, 6) Candidate and 7) Votes:

```
head -n 2 presidential_election_results.denorm.csv | cut -d, -f5,6,7 | tr , '\t'
```

```
party candidate votes
```

```
UNP Junius Richard Jayewardene 29380
```

To see all the Colombo North Results for 1982:

```
cat  presidential_election_results.denorm.csv | grep 1982 | grep "Colombo North"  | cut -d, -f5,6,7 | tr , '\t'

```

```
LSSP Colvin Reginald de Silva 361
```

```
ACTC Kumar Ponnambalam 477
```

```
NSSP Vasudeva Nanayakkara 60
```

In descending order of votes:

```
cat  presidential_election_results.denorm.csv | grep 1982 | grep "Colombo North"  | sort -t, -nr -k7 | cut -d, -f5,6,7 | tr , '\t'
```
