# On Cutting the Cake (Part 3)

### Stock for Employees and the Motivation Principle

In On Cutting the Cake, I discussed the topic of splitting startup stock in general, and the principle of proportionality in particular:

>>> Any dividend or profit or gain should be proportional to investment share

>>> Any loss should also be proportional to investment share

In this follow-up, I discuss a corollary of the Proportionality Principle, which I will call the Motivation Principle, and in particular, discuss its effect on employees.

## A personal note: Silicon Valley vs. Silicon Isle

When I first interviewed for software engineer jobs in Silicon Valley, I had the following new experience: In addition to a cash salary, my compensation offers also included stock. In some cases, the stock component even exceeded the cash component. Startups almost always offered stock, and so did many "big" companies — especially to high quality candidates.

In fact, for high quality candidates, in addition to higher cash compensation, companies also offered a higher proportion of stock compensation. This implied that companies assumed that higher quality candidates valued stock more than cash.

While I had some work experience in Sri Lanka before I moved to California, I had never encountered, or even heard of a Sri Lankan tech company offering stock (note this was back in 2007).

## The Motivation Principle

When both profit and loss is proportional to investment (Proportionality Principle) investors want to do their best to maximise the former and minimise the latter, motivating everything from working harder, to working smarter. Hence, the Proportionality Principle motivates investors to re-invest in all sorts of beneficial ways.

Or in other words:

>>> Proportional investment, motivates further investment.

This is what I call the Motivation Principle.

An obvious corollary of the Motivation Principle is if you want an employee to work hard and smart, give them stock. Better still, make sure that stock is proportional to performance.

Note, disproportionalities would result in asymmetric motivation, or even demotivation. For example, if a company is doing well, employees without stock would feel less part of this success, particularly since they don't get to completely share in it. On the other hand, if the company is doing badly, such employees would care less.

## Conclusion

The conclusion is simple. Give 'em stock.
