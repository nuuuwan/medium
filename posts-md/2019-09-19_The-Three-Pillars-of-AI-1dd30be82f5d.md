# The Three Pillars of AI

### Can an organization succeed at AI?

AI is the buzzword of all buzzwords these days. Everyone wants to do AI. Students want to study AI at school and university. Tech Startups wish to build the next "big AI idea". Organizations want to be "AI-first". Countries wish to define AI policies and manifestos.

All these parties should be asking one question: Can we succeed at AI?

In this article, I focus on one of these parties: Organizations. I want to answer the question: "Can an organization succeed at AI?"

## 1. Technology

The first pillar of AI is technology.

When people talk about AI, they (usually) talk about Technology: AI hardware or AI software. Some of the biggest recent leaps in AI have come from advances in hardware. Chips are capable of the extraordinary processing power that AI algorithms need. The internet of things logs vast amounts of data which AI systems can crunch. High bandwidth networks, shuttle data to and from, at high speed and low cost. Advances in software have piggy-backed on this hardware. The theory and algorithms behind deep-learning (for example) are decades old. But it is the recent hardware advances that have made these practical and useful.

Most AI algorithms are part of open source projects. Scientific journals usually document those that are not. Hence, AI software is almost free. In contrast, hardware requires physical machines, energy, and thus, money. Therefore, an organization's ability to access technology is a question of financial resources.

## 2. Business

AI is a problem-solving tool and uses data from the past to solve the problems of the future. Hence, an organization should only invest in AI,

* If it has data

* If the gains from AI solutions, benefits the organizations bottom line

This mix of data and business sense dictates if the organization has a business case for using AI. The second pillar.

## 3. People

Technology and business opportunities don't explore and exploit themselves. An organization needs skilled humans to perform this exploration and exploitation process.

Identifying problems that might benefit the organization's bottom-line, requires considerable domain knowledge. These problems need translation into a form that AI techniques might solve. The relevant technology pipelines need to be placed to solve these problems. The system as a whole needs monitoring, maintenance, and constant optimization.

Hence, AI depends most on this third and most crucial pillar: People.

## Anti-Patterns

An organization that does not have one or more of these pillars is unlikely to succeed at AI. Next, I discuss some specific examples of such "anti-pattern" organizations.

### The Outsourcer (Technology + Business, No People)

These companies have considerable financial resources, which enable them to invest in technology. They also have exciting business problems and AI-happy data. Unfortunately, they don't have the people expertise to build and exploit AI solutions. Hence, these companies outsource the people aspects of an AI system to third parties.

This approach has two serious dangers:

* Third parties have incomplete domain knowledge and imperfect incentives. Their solutions are never optimal.

* Third parties steal the organization's data. They sell it to competitors and engage in other conflicts of interest.

A variation of "The outsourcer" is the "Blind off-the-shelf user". These organizations live off off-the-shelf AI platforms from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Without paying heed to the consequences, the dangers are precisely the same.

### The Enthusiast (Technology + People, No Business)

Enthusiast organizations are like Outsourcers, in that they have financial resources. They also understand the importance of hiring good people. I.e. Machine learning engineers, data scientists, and domain experts.

Unfortunately (unlike Outsourcers), these companies don't have a business case for AI.

### The Poorman (Business + People, No Technology)

These organizations have both a compelling business case for AI and people. Unfortunately, they don't have the resources to invest in technology.

## Anti-Patterns (continued)

Each of the above examples lacks one pillar of AI. Many companies lack more:

* The Outsourcer Enthusiast (Only Technology). These invest in fancy technology without giving a thought about people or business.

* The Untapped Opportunity (Only Business). These organizations have a business case for AI. But have neither people nor resources to invest in technology.

* The AI Club (Only People). These organizations have neither a business case for AI nor technology. But they do have a group of people interested, even expert in AI. It is more of a social club for these people than an impact-making organization.

## Conclusion: Building Pillars

Of the three pillars, the business pillar is the only one innate to the nature of the organization. If this does not exist, the organization should not consider AI.

On the other hand, an organization can build the people and technology pillars from scratch: the former, by building an AI-savvy organization; the latter, by seeking investment.

Your organization might be one of these anti-patterns. If you lack the business pillar, then you should quit AI. If you do have a compelling business case, consider building the missing pillars.
