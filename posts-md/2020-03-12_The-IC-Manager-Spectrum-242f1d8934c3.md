# The IC-Manager Spectrum

### Should an Engineering Manager write code?

## In theory

Software Engineering organizations have two types of employees: Engineering Managers and Individual Contributors (ICs).

ICs contribute to the company through their (own individual) effort. They design and implement systems; usually, by writing code.

Managers contribute through "helping others contribute". At Facebook [where I was both an IC and an Engineering Manager for eight-plus years], managers were supposed to support their managees (or reports), in four ways:

* Provide Context. Help ICs understand how what they do connects to the "Big Picture".

* Set Focus. Help ICs focus on what is essential and ignore the rest.

* Drive Impact. Help ICs translate what they do to top-line impact.

* Cultivate Growth. Help ICs grow and progress

[See Mantras for Managers by colleague and ex-Facebook Engineering Manager John Lusty, for more details on these "four ways"]

A manager's "impact" must be "incremental". If the company credits a manager for all their ICs impact (as well as the ICs), there will be "double-counting". Instead, the company rewards managers for the "incremental impact" their ICs make, compared to had the manager not existed.

Hence, managers needed one set of skills; ICs another. At least in theory.

## In practice

There is no such thing as a 100% manager or a 100% IC. In practice, most people are somewhere in between.

If a software engineer, mentors another, they are "managing" to some extent. Similarly, if a manager spends time designing a system or even writing code, they are "ICing".

As an IC gains experience, they tend to do more "managery" tasks, like mentoring. Facebook evaluated IC Engineers across three dimensions: 1) Technical; 2) Product; and 3) People. The "People" dimension had a substantial "management" component. The "weights" of the dimensions changed with the ICs experience. While a junior Engineer's "People Dimension" might weigh 10%, it could be 50% or more for a senior engineer.

These "dimensions" reflected the diversity of expectations. The same applied for Managers.

## How to make this work

Hence, in practice, there is a spectrum; from a "pure" IC to a "pure" manager. Whether or not the spectrum is effective, depends on how the company is organized and managed.

### 1. Structure

Definitions of roles and levels must be consistent with an IC-Manager spectrum.

In many organizations, managers are "above" ICs. ICs, once they reach a certain level, are "promoted" to management. In such an organization, an IC could take on some manager tasks, especially if they "aspire to management". On the other hand, a manager doing IC work might be considered "beneath them". This also resulted in senior ICs who could not progress further. These "dead-end ICs" tended to stagnate or leave the organization.

A better structure is one where ICs and managers are equal in level. For example, Facebook had the following structure. The company promoted ICs to more senior ICs, and managers to more senior managers, it never "promoted" ICs to management. When an IC became a manager (and vice versa), the move was known as a "transition".

### 2. Expectations

Setting the right expectation is critical. Managers at Facebook had an explicit "agreement" with their managers, about the IC-Manager Balance. Their performance was measured relative to that expectation.

While at Facebook, I moved back and forth through the spectrum: I was a 100% IC, a 100% Manager, a ~50% IC (with 50% "managing") and a ~50% Manager (with 50% individual contributing); and a multitude of shades in-between.

### 3. Roles

It is easier to be something if that something has a name.

Is a 50% manager/50% IC a "manager" or an "IC"?

While the company would expect such an employee to make the same aggregate impact as a manager or IC at the same level, their impact purely as a manager, or IC would fall short of a 100% manager, or a 100% IC. Hence, they will be undervalued if they are judged relative to a "pure" role.

At Facebook, these roles were known as "IC-Manager-Hybrid". Expectations were accordingly set, and performance was relatively measured.

## Concluding Thoughts

The term "Manager" has some historical baggage. "ICs" were associated with the "working class", and consigned to that lowly position for eternity. Managers were an elite, were often parachuted in from a different pool of candidates, often with different backgrounds and no "technical" qualifications. This historical class structure still prevails in many companies.

Tech Companies (or at least the better Tech Companies), on the other hand, have diverged from this model. Instead of a class system, status depends on impact. Hence, an IC making more impact than a manager holds a higher position.

It probably boils down to what you value more. History appreciated a status quo; the modern tech company values impact.

Finally, should an engineering manager write code?

The depends on two factors:

* Can the engineering manager write code? Any EM worth their salt should be able to write excellent code.

* Does the company support it? The better tech companies do. This article might help those who don't but want to.
