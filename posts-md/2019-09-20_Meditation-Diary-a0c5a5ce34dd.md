### Notes of a novice meditator

## 9/20

Fantasising in time (about past and future), and inner speech (associative thought) have one thing in common. Both acquire knowledge that assumes the permanence of certain concepts. Hence, ignorance of knowledge is wiser than ignorant knowledge.

The abstraction of breathing in and breathing out: It led me to believe that breathing was breathing in and breathing out. It is that, but so much more. I've let go of that abstraction.

## 9/19

Today, I used the five fetters — Sensual Desire (Kamaccanda), Ill-will (Viyapada), Sloth and Torpor (Tina Middha), Restless and Remorse (Uddacca Kukkucca), and Doubt (Vicikicca) — as a sort of mantra as I meditated.

Each time one of these emerged, I would make it my mantra. Each time another appeared, I would switch to that.

This practice helps me understand what fetters dominate my meditation.
