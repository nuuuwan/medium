# On Small Plans and Big Plans

### Costs, Benefits and Success

* Small plans have small costs. Big plans have very big costs.

* Small plans have small benefits. Big plans have unknown, and possibly non-existent benefits.

* Small plans have a small chance of success. Big plans, with no intermediate validation, have no chance of success.

* It is impossible to know the cost, benefit or chance of success of a plan, with any certainty, for all but the smallest of plans.

### Action

* A plan that has a combination of too high costs, too low benefits, or a too low chance of success, or too much uncertainty about any of these factors, is not actionable.

* Beyond a certain bigness, all plans are non-actionable. They are less plans and more hunches, hopes or dreams.

* It is easy to represent a meaningful problem as an abstract, big plan. But it is hard to decompose a big plan into concrete and actionable small plans.

### Fatality

* There is a maximum cost a business can bare at any time. Any plan that risks exceeding this cost is potentially fatal for the business. Obviously, fatal plans must be avoided at all costs.

* For any plan that has a 50% chance of being fatal, dividing it into 2 sub plans — that each bear half of the costs, half of the benefits, the same 50% fatality risk, and are risk-wise independent — reduces the fatality risk to 25%. With 10 sub plans, the fatality risk is less than 0.1%.

* Hence, in general, a big number of small plans are significantly less fatal, than a small number of big plans.

### Missions and Strategies

* A "business mission" is a very big plan, and hence, on its own, is rarely actionable. Its value chiefly lies in providing a yardstick for measuring the benefit of small plans.

* A "business strategy" is a constrained business mission, which trades-off size for certainty. But too often, most business strategies are also too big, and hence non-actionable.

* It is easier to compose a meaningful big plan from many small plans, than it is to decompose many small plans out of a big plan. This is the biggest problem with big plans. The biggest problem with Small plans is that it is hard to predict what big plan their composition forms (or in other words if they are collectively beneficial).

* Some of the best business missions and strategies are retrospective. They "emerge" from small plans.

### Organizations

* A business can either work on a small number of big plans, or work on many independent small plans. The latter businesses are almost always more successful.

* A manager can either decompose big plans into small plans and assign them to their reports, or create an environment where their reports can work on small plans, and provide feedback on how beneficial and successful those small plans are. The latter managers are almost always more successful.

* Hence, management is more ecology, than zoology.

* The skill of executing a small plan can be wholly measured in terms of the cost and benefit of that plan. The skill of executing a large plan can be only measured in terms of environment and feedback.
