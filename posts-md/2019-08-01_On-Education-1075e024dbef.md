### Why education is what it is, and what it will be

"The Classroom of the Future" and education in general is a hot topic these days. The likes of Sir Ken Robinson wax eloquent on all that is broken about our current education and all that it must be fixed in the future. Growing income inequality, the threat of Artificial Intelligence, and rising education costs and debt have further fuelled this discussion.

I want to consider different questions in this article. Not "What education should be" but "Why education is what it is" and "What education will be".

## Meanwhile in Sri Lanka...

Recently, a group of unemployed university graduates were protesting, demanding that the government provide them with jobs. This state of affairs is not surprising when you consider the following:

* The majority of schools in Sri Lanka don't support advanced level classes in the physical and biological science streams. Hence, most of the students graduating from school follow the arts stream. In an effort not to discriminate these students, the government has pushed universities to align their input with this output from schools. Hence, most students admitted to universities study, and then graduate in arts subjects. These numbers are wildly out of sync with employment demand. There are far too many arts grads with far few jobs, and vice versa for medicine, and STEM jobs.

* There is almost a religious respect for education in Sri Lanka. Hence, any education is better than no education. With the exception of a few discerning parents, many spend vast amounts of money to educate their children at third-rate universities abroad. Many take loans or sell the ancestral estate to pay these bills. For those who are not fortunate enough to receive a university education, there are all manner of two, three, and four-letter qualifications and diplomas available for a fee. For peddlers of such qualifications (especially from the U.K.), Sri Lanka is a favourite destination. Bottom line — many Sri Lankans get some education, without paying any attention to its relevance (or more accurately, its irrelevance).

* Sri Lanka has a highly incompetent mob of politicians, who, in addition to lining their pockets, care only about one thing: getting re-elected, every 4, 5 or 6 years. While they are mostly incapable of delivering development or a better standard of living, there is one thing they can reasonably guarantee: A job in the bloated state sector.

Hence, there are two types of graduates in Sri Lanka:

* Graduates in fields with too many jobs, but too few graduates

* Graduates in fields with too many graduates with too few jobs, who have a implicit employment contract with the state (i.e. "I know I have a crap degree, but you know you have to give me a job")

## Why Education

But what is the point of education? In its broadest sense, education provides (us humans) a set of tools to satisfy (our human) needs, in the broadest sense.

However, as I implied, this is a very broad definition. In general, even the most respected education institutions (e.g. the worlds top universities), mostly focus on a subset of these tools and needs — namely, the bottom "Professional Skills".

"Professional Skills" are the basic skills that define a professions; for example, what enables a doctor to prescribe medication, or a surgeon to perform surgery, or a journalist to write a news article, or a computer scientist to design a computer system. 99% of most university curriculums will focus on these skills. At a needs level, these will guarantee one a job — and hence a salary, enabling physiological and safety needs to be satisfied.

However, beyond doing what you are expected to do and getting paid for it, humans need and crave other skills. Even in the professional workplace, humans need social, behavioural, and cultural skills to effectively collaborate with peers and customers. This is why many top MBA programs are also beginning to offer golfing, sailing and social dancing courses.

Finally, there is there are internal psychological needs, around self-actualization and transcendence. For example, does an employee have the mindset to work hard and grow? Or the ability to self-criticize and reflect? In my professional career as a computer scientist, software engineer and engineering manager, there were many times where philosophy (of Marcus Aurelius, to Socrates, to Lao Tse, to the Buddha) was invaluable, but in nearly 25 years of formal education (in some very good educational institutions), it was never required for me to take a course in any type of philosophy.

Hence, education is broad and important. But sadly, our perception of education, and that of educational instituitions, and the state, is very narrow.

## What education is

It is not surprising that formal education focusses on the bottom of the needs hierarchy. It is simply a matter of prioritization. Educational institutions and states focus the most benefit, at the least cost. Hence, formal education focusses on professional skills.

Even within professional skills, institutions tend to focus on the lower mechanistic skills, which can be imparted at the lowest cost to the most number of students. These include information and processes that can be rote learned, and tested in a standardised (and inexpensive) way. Hence, professional skills that focus on creativity and critical thinking (as opposed to mechanical non-thinking) receieve less attention. For example, through an undergraduate and graduate education in computer science, I never had to build a meaningful computer system that got used by actual people. For this type of education, I had to rely on side-projects, and finally employement itself.

Hence, just as I educated myself on some of the more creative aspects of computer science, the higher means of education do exist. It's just that they don't really happen in traditional educational institutions. Parties, events and other social gatherings are far more educational at social, behavioural, or cultural level than universities, as is reflection and meditation at a mindset and philosophical level.

Traditionally, education has been seen as a social and economic leveller, and the traditional educational institutions (school and university) — the engines that performed this transformation. This worked well in the 19th and much of the 20th century when most of the even most "professional" professions were mechanised and depended on little creativity. For example, the British educational system (an ancestor of Sri Lanka's current system), was designed to produce an army of civil servants from Canada, to Ceylon, to New Zealand, who all performed the same mechanised tasks, in exactly the same way. That world is dead, but we are left with the same education system.

## What education will be

The likes of Sir Ken have grand visions for education in the future: some of them involve significant interventions, most of them top-down, involving huge investments. I prefer to think bottom-up — try and analyse the situation from that stand point, and build my conclusions based on that.

Here are some predictions about the future, based on this bottom-up reasoning:

* Educational institutions (in their current form) will disappear. With advances in technology and artificial intelligence, all the remaining forms of mechanised employment will disappear, and with it the relevance of mechanised education. Education will have to focus on higher level professional skills (like creativity) and providing tools for higher level human needs.

* The void left by these institutions will be largely filled by parents and students. High income individuals will have a huge advantage, as education focussing on higher level needs will require significantly more time and money. Many accuse current educational institutions of being too expensive; those of the future (if any) will be orders of magnitude more expensive.

* Inequalities will increase in wealth, power and dignity. The "education is a leveller" contract between state and citizen will breakdown. Protests (e.g. that of the unemployed arts graduates) will increase; vialble solutions will decrease. This transformation will also happen in fields which currently don't face employment shortages like computer science. In the (possibly near) future, computer science graduates will be the ones protesting for jobs.

These might sound gloomy and pessimistic. Then again, it is what it is. And hopefully, we make the best of the situation.

Acceptance is the first step.
