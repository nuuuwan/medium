# On Anti-Thought

### And the perils of meetings in tall buildings

Today, I had a meeting on one of the top floors of a high-rise building. At the ground-floor reception, I realised I didn't know which floor.

At this moment, a thought occurred to me. I thought, "I'll ask the receptionist!"

And so I asked the receptionist where such and such company was. And the receptionist said such and such floor.

So, I took the lift to that such and such floor.

...

In the lift, another thought occurred to me.

Before I had asked the receptionist, I had to think: "On which floor is my meeting?"

But after she replied, I didn't need to think. I knew!

I had knowledge. And that knowledge had taken away my need to think. The Dr. Jekyll of Knowledge had spawned a grotesque side-kick — the Mr. Hyde of anti-thought!

...

And then, a third, darker thought occurred.

The receptionist could have been mistaken. What I thought knowledge might be ignorance. I might be heading to the wrong floor, the wrong company, and the wrong meeting. A completely wrong future!

And what about other things I think I know? Other forms of knowledge which might be ignorance?

I might be nonchalantly basking in the light of my supposed-knowledge, while hurtling towards a spectre of darkeness and certain doom. And thanks to anti-thought, I might not be able to defend myself!
