Great question.

The problem is a "bigness" of the idea. All big ideas tend to carry big risk.

The only "framework" I can think of to get around this is to try and break down the big idea into many small ideas. In parallel, if it is possible to test these small ideas very quickly, their low cost becomes even lower. This leads to the classic "test small + iterate fast" cycle.
