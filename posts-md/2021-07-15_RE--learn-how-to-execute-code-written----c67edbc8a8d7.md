RE: learn how to execute code written...

Fortunately, if you're hitting roadblocks, the odds are that so are other people.

So, whenever you do (e.g. get an error), you should Google it and see how other people dealth with the problem.

https://stackoverflow.com is the usual, goto place for issues. It is usually the top hit when you google a problem/bug/error or other issue.
