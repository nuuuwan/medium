# Engis (Part 1)

### The Murder of Queen Elizabeth II

There are at least two problems with the English language.

* Pronunciation: There is no deterministic relationship between words and sound

* Grammar: It is far too complicated

In a series of articles, we will solve these problems, by inventing a new language: En-gis.

This article, is the first in the series, where we will solve the problem of English Pronunciation.

## Alphabet Soup

As a preliminary step to solving pronunciation, let's clean-up the abomination that is the English Alphabet.

The English Alphabet has two problems:

* The letters are not in any particular order. For example, the vowels A, E, I, O, U appear all over the place

* There are redundant letters. Why should we have a W, given that we already have a V? And what's the use of a Q when we have a perfectly serviceable K? And don't even get me started on X. Is that even a sound?

Hence, let's start with putting the vowels at the beginning:

A E I O U

Next, let's omit redundant letters: W (sounds like V), Q (sounds like K), X (sounds like nothing on earth).

Finally, let's organize the remaining consonants in order of sound:

* Palette sounds: K G

* Hard palette sounds: C J

* Alveolar ridge sounds: T D N

* Lip sounds: P B M

* Other sounds: Y R L V S H F Z

Hence, are new 23 letter A to Z is:

A E I O U K G C J T D N P B M Y R L V S H F Z

Much better.

## Vowels

Since we have only five vowels, we can have only 5 vowel sounds. Hence, let's choose the most intuitive sounds, given the five vowel letters:

* "At"

* "Egg"

* "It"

* "Of"

* "fUll"

Let's restrict ourselves to "short" vowel sounds, and ignore all other vowel sounds and diphthong.

## Consonants

* Kit, Git

* Chat, Jack

* Tick, Dick, Nick

* Pun, Bun, Mum

* Yum, Rum, Lat, Vat, Sat, Hat, Fat, Zoo

Just as we ignore most vowel sounds, we will ignore all combinations of consonents.

And we are done.

## Example: Translating words from English to Engis

Before:

>>> Send her victorious,

>>> Happy and glorious,

>>> Long to reign over us,

>>> God save the Queen!

After:

>>> Sen he viktorius,

>>> Hapi an gorius,

>>> Lon to ren ove us,

>>> God sev da Kin!

[For some reason, this sounds best in Nelson Mandela's voice]
