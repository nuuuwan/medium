### 6 UI Design Tests from a Non-Designer

I'm a computer scientist, not a UI Designer. I have no qualifications, or proper experience in UI Design. However, in the last couple of months, I've had to do quite a lot of "UI Design" out of necessity; partly because good UI Designers are hard to find and hire, and partly because I was part of "early-stage developments" that could not afford the said experts.

In this article, I list some insights I've learnt by "trying to be a designer". It is structured as "6 tests" that could be used to verify if a UI Design is a good (enough) design.

Disclaimer: The professional designers among you (some my friends and former colleagues), might laugh or cry at the rest of this article, as it is not really grounded in formal or academic design principles. Hence, if this article is not useful as a pattern to follow, it will, at least, be useful as an anti-pattern not to follow.

### Drawing Test

Good Designs are almost always simple, and memorable.

When I test the design of a new screen for the first time with a new customer, I ask them if they can take a blank piece of paper and draw what they saw from memory. They might not remember 100% of all the details, but if they get 60–80% right, then I know that the design is simple enough, and more importantly memorable.

### Engagement Test

While some UI components are intended to be "read", for a product to be meaningful, we need users to "do things" or "act". Hence, the best designs motivate the user to do something. Crude "engagement tactics" coerce users to click buttons or do other mechanical things. True engagement, on the other hand, inspires, and motivates users to get the best value out of the product.

When a user interacts with my product for the first time, I see how long it takes for them to "do something" meaningful, ideally without me having to tell them anything.

### Science Test

Most skills, including design, are a mix of art and science.

The art of design is about producing something novel and creative. The "science" of design is all the data we have about how people use a product, how we want a user to use a product, and the wealth of theoretical knowledge about colour, space, and form. Art and Science must compliment. For example, if the "science" says that the most productive action that can happen on a page is X, then the majority of the design real-estate should focus on enabling and encouraging this action.

The "test" consists of verifying if the science and the art are in sync.

### IKEA Test

A test that IKEA uses to test its furniture products is to ask volunteers to try and assemble furniture without the instruction manual. Similarly, how to use a web product should be intuitive enough so as not to need help or other explicit instructions.

When a test user sees a product for the first time, I ask them to try and do X without giving them any help on how. And if they can do this quickly, without asking questions, my design has "passed the IKEA test".

### Good-Looking Test

A good design "looks good". One problem with "looking good" is that often we know when something looks good, but don't know why; rather like a painting or a piece of music. Hence, the problem with this test is that it might not be clear what to do if the test "fails".

Either way, we must continue to iterate, until more and more users agree that the design "looks good".

### Noob Test

Finally, the Noob test is a sort of meta-test for all other tests.

All of the tests should pass if the "test user" is a total novice, inexpert, and completely new to the product.

A good design should work just as well with a novice, compared to an expert.

## So, in summary...

* Drawing

* Engagement

* Science

* IKEA

* Good-looking

* Noob

Go forth and D-E-S-I-G-N!
