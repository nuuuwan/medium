# Beyond Thinking

### Contemplations overlooking the sea

>>> Me: What is the opposite of "Thinking"?

>>> You: "Not Thinking"?

>>> Me: That's like saying, "the opposite of doing a good deed is doing no deed at all" or "the opposite of growing tall is staying the same size" or "the opposite of multiplying a number by 2, is not multiplying the number by 2".

>>> You: Ok. What about "Thinking illogically, irrationally, or negative thoughts"?

>>> Me: That's still not quite what I was looking for.

>>> You: Why?

>>> Me: "Thinking bad thoughts" is still thinking; like saying, "the opposite of doing a good deed is doing a bad deed" or "the opposite of growing tall is growing short" or "the opposite of multiplying a number by 2, is dividing the number by 2".

>>> You: Ok. If the opposite of multiplying is neither not multiplying nor dividing, what particular opposite are you looking for?

## A sea that is oddly still

To answer your question, we would need to first define "Thinking". What exactly happens when we are thinking?

To find out, we could try the following experiment: a) Let's watch out for the next thought that comes to our mind; b) Let's try and describe, not the thought, but the process of thinking. In my case this is what happened.

For a moment, I happened to look up from my laptop, out of the window, and I see the sea. I think,

>>> For a rainy day, the sea is oddly still, isn't it?

Several things happened. First, I saw the sea. Second, I also had some notion of "the day". Then, I labelled the sea as "oddly still"after already naming "the day" as "rainy". "Still" and "rainy" are words that I already know, and I can easily associate with other examples of "rainy" and "still".

Let's watch out for another example. I happen to notice the time on the clock. Just passed 5pm. I think,

>>> I should make tea.

And that's what I end-up doing.

## Thoughts over a cuppa

Within both these instances of "thinking", I've associated "things that I know" with "other things that I know". For example,

* "Sea" and "still"

* "Day" and "rainy"

* "Tea" and "5pm"

By "associating" I've effectively reduced "something that I can't explain" to something that I can.

For example, a moment after I saw the sea in the evening light, it was something unexplained and unexplainable. But the moment I labelled it as "still", I reduced it to something I know and can explain. And more importantly, something about which I don't need to think any more.

The sea is still. That's all there is to it.

## Tiny ripples and strange shadows

But this "explanation" of the sea is oddly unsatisfying. For a start, I can stare at the sea, fascinated, almost endlessly, even when it is "still". Surely, there is more to it than "still"? And of course, there is.

I look out of the window again. This time, I'm determined not to think. I manage a couple of minutes, completely void of thought. And then I reflect on what happened.

>>> I see many things. The sea is not quite still. There are tiny ripples. And there are silver lines between these ripples. The clouds place strange shadows on the sea. I not only see the sea, but can hear the sea, and feel the sea's breeze on my face. And if I concentrate, even though the sea is several miles away, I can, faintly, smell the sea.

I could go on and on, but if I've proved one thing, it is this: There's a lot more to the sea than "being still". So what was I thinking?

## The sea that is chosen to see

But I'm less interested in what I was thinking. This "contemplation" of the sea led to far more interesting thoughts about the sea, despite, perhaps because, of the fact that I was not thinking. I was taking in all the unexplainable signals about the concrete sea, without seeking abstract explanations. Hence, there was no "reduction" from a concrete unexplainable to an abstract explainable.

But would it be possible to take this process even further?

Consider what happened when I "saw" the sea. Various particles reflected off the surface of the water, and my eye detected some of these. Note, the particles detected by my eye satisfied two conditions:

* They were reflected off the sea, and hence a function of the sea; and

* They were detected by my eye, and thus, a function of my eye

Assuming the sea is "real" and "absolute", what if my eye was doing what my "thinking" was doing? Suppose it "chose" what to see, to simplify and explain the sea?

## A conclusion of a thousand words

But now I'm straying into rambling speculation.

>>> (Exasperated) You: If the opposite of multiplying is neither not multiplying nor dividing, what is?

>>> Me (Vague): It's subtracting the number from itself.

Let me end with a picture.

You can perhaps think about this picture, or even better contemplate, or even better "realize" (whatever that means).

Perhaps by the sea, sipping a cup of tea.
