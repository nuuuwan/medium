# Confessions of a Compulsive Coffee Consumer

### Dos and Don'ts

## Do drink blends of coffee you're familiar with.

Or blends that are similar to these blends. Familiarity builds attraction. You are more likely to like familiar flavours.

## Do understand what you like about coffee.

What are the characteristics of coffee that you like? Do you like acidity? Or bitterness? Or are their flavours (or "notes") you like? Identify these and look for these.

## Don't consume too often.

When you eat or drink anything (coffee included), you develop a "memory" of the experience. This memory discourages you from consuming more of the same thing. It's our bodies way of saying "moderation!".

Leave at least several hours between cups for the best experience. If there is a coffee or cafe that you particularly like, limit even further. Several days. Or even weeks.

## Do look forward to drinking coffee.

If you know you're going to have a cuppa in an hour, that's something good to look forward to.

On the other hand, don't let the interval be too long. If you're checking out a new cafe (which is supposed to be awesome) in two weeks time, it's probably best to forget it.

## Do make an effort.

Making coffee yourself has a fantastic IKEA effect. Ideally, make coffee from "first principles". Roast the beans, grind them by hand, and brew it in an old-fashioned stove-top Moka pot.

Consume the beverage in pleasant circumstances. If you're living room is a mess, clean first, consume second. The drinking will be all the more pleasurable.

Happy Drinking!
