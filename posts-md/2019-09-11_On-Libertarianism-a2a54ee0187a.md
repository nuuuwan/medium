### A Critique

Libertarianism is a political philosophy that expounds that, the highest moral good is "an individual's right to satisfy their interests". The optimal way to secure this good is through "individuals making individual rational decisions".

Hence, Libertarianism relies on the trueness of the following propositions:

>>> A. The highest moral good is "an individual's right to satisfy their interests".

>>> B. The optimal way to secure this good is through "individuals making individual rational decisions".

>>> C. Individuals can make individual rational decisions.

Let's look at each of these, one by one, in reverse order.

## C. Rationality

Unfortunately, according to the latest findings of medicine, psychology and behavioural economics, humans rarely make rational decisions. Humans are more "rationalizing" than rational. We do something (without any rational basis), and then post-rationalize some excuse after the fact.

Hence, C can't be true.

## B. Decisions

But suppose for argument's sake we assume that C is true, that humans can, at least in the interests of satisfying their interests, make rational decisions. Would B hold as well?

Why would an isolated individual decision be more optimal to one made as a collection of individuals? Wouldn't a collective of individuals be more creative than a single individual, and have access to more information than one?

Also, what about the manifold instances where individuals defer decisions to others? As in the case of doctors? And generals? Why not even politicians?

Hence, B also breaks down.

## A. Interests

But suppose we ignore everything above and assume B and C to be true. Why should A also be true?

Don't many people see moral good in interests beyond the individual? Don't many people see moral good in pursuing and satisfying the interests of others (altruism)? And don't many people combine the interests of self and others, and seek the good of the collective?

Hence, A breaks down too.

## The Religion of Libertarianism

With A, B, and C all breaking down, the only way anyone can be a Libertarian, is if they accept A, B, and C as a matter of "faith", i.e. "based on spiritual conviction rather than proof".

This faith seems to be abundant in most Libertarians I've met. Libertarians sound a lot like Religious fanatics, often nitpicking facts, and trying to make points through the force of force, misinformation, emotion, and irrationality, as opposed to the force of rational argument.

Hence, the paradox of Libertarianism is, that for a philosophy that claims to worship rationality, it relies almost entirely on irrationality.

Libertarianism has another parallel with many religious scams like mega-churches and tele-evangelism, where a few people get rich, while making many poor. If you happen to be a scammer, monopolistic plutocrat, or robber-baron yourself, it would probably be in your interests to convince as many people that no one should interfere with your "right to satisfy your interests". Why not make a donation to the Libertarian party? High ROI (return-on-investment), methinks.
