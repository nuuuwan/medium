# Searching for "Sex" in Sri Lanka

### Using Google Trends

The Daily Mirror reported,

>>> "Ethiopia topped the list among the 10 nations that searched for the word ‘sex' the most on Google in the second quarter of 2020, whilst Sri Lanka was placed second."

The trend is not new. As the Daily Mirror said,

>>> "Sri Lanka topped the list in Google searches for the word ‘sex' for five consecutive years from 2012 to 2016."

Various commentators have interpreted these results in various ways. Some possibly flawed. In this article, I try to understand how Google Trends works and debunk some myths surrounding searching for "Sex" in Sri Lanka.

## Google Trends: A Brief Tutorial

Suppose you got to Google Trends, and search for the word "Sex" from "2004-Present" "Wordwide".

You will see two graphs.

### Interest over Time

The first graph indicates the "Interest Over Time" for the search term. The "Interest" (on the Y-axis) is an a value from 0 to 100. The value is 100 at the point of time (X-axis) when the given search term (e.g. "sex") was at its highest in terms of the "percentage of searches".

For "sex" this high point was in July 2017. Where we can see that the index was "100".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QkgDl2I-W1TyLy5EWz0RJg.png)

The interest values for all other points of time are relative to this value. For example, currently (September 2020) the interest is 82. This means that currently the proportion of searches that search for sex is about 82% of what it was in July 2017.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0h5y8_6lhpuulO_BvqhYzw.png)

Note, we don't know what this actual proportion is. We only know the proportion (say in September 2020) relative to the high point (July 2017). If 10% of searches in July 2017 were for "sex", then the proportion in September 2020 was about 8.2%.

Similarly, we also don't know the absolute number. We can't say that there were fewer searches for sex in September 2020 worldwide, because the total number of searches could have increased. For example, if the total number of searches in July 2017 was 10M (this is a guesstimate, I don't know the exact number), and assuming that 10% of searches were for sex, we have 1M searches for sex. If the number of total searches in September 2020 increased to 20M, then we have about 1.64M searches for sex in September 2020. Or more than July 2017.

### Interest by Region

The second graph indicates "Interest by Region". For the region you selected ("Worldwide"), you see the results broken down by sub-regions of that regions ("Country").

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Q89ZICed5SSb5dhjn69QMw.png)

Each country has an "Interest" value. Again ranging from 0 to 100. 100 is assigned to the Country with the highest proportion of searches for the search term. For "sex" this is Ethiopia.

Note, just as we did not know the exact proportion of "sex" searches" or the absolute number of "sex searches" in July 2017, we don't know the proportions or absolute numbers of "sex searches" for Ethiopia. All we know is that it has the highest proportion across the world. This proportion could be very large or very small. We just don't know.

Again, just as the "interest" values for other points of time (e.g. September 2020) were relative to the high point (July 2017), the "interest" values for other countries are relative to Ethiopia. For example, the proportion of web searches that are for "sex" in Sri Lanka, are about 91% of that of Ethiopia. So, if the proportion in Ethiopia is 10%, then Sri Lanka is 9.1%. If it is 0.1%, Sri Lanka is 0.91%. But we don't know what the proportions actually are. Nor do we know the absolute numbers.

Also, note, the above compares the highpoint of Ethiopia, to the highpoint of Sri Lanka. If we change the time window (say from "2004-present) to "last 12 months", the high-points change, and the results also change.

### Search within Sri Lanka

Just as we searched world-wide, we can also search for trends within a country, like Sri Lanka.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xqd_b9PlTGZsaSo1o_vbSg.png)

We intepret the results just as we did for "Worldwide".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hSwGx3HIfTWCWQ2_mrNlOQ.png)

Similar to the world as a whole, the highpoint in time for searching for "sex" in Sri Lanka was July 2017.

In "Interest by subregion", just as "Worldwide" broke into countries, "Sri Lanka" is broken down into provinces.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ielZh_kItn6oKlBhq7ctDg.png)

"North Central Province" has the highest proportion of "sex" searches. Followed by the "Northern Province" etc.

### Analysing Multiple Search Terms

Google Trends also supports searching for multiple search terms. For example, suppose you search for "Facebook", "Sex", "XXX" and "Porn".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qynbF81Ng3rJKdADkeQPfg.png)

Similar to before, the "interest" value is 100 for the search term with the highest proportion at some point of time. This was in Aug 2013, for the search term "Facebook".

## Debunking Potential Myths

[Note: All the claims are assumed to be for the "last 12 months", unless otherwise indicated]

### 1. Sri Lanka has more searches for "sex" than any other country, except Ethiopia.

Google's "Interest" metric is proportional to the "proportion of searches" for "sex". Not the absolute number. If we want a compare countries by absolute number of searches, we should normalise the interest value, by the number of internet users (which I assume is proportional to the number of total Google Searches).

Once, we do this normalisation, we see that Sri Lanka drops from second place to 11th place. Hence, the claim is FALSE.

Matching our intuitions, the countries at the top have large populations.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d_caQBBmS6PTp4zl9vSd5A.png)

11th is still quite high. Particularly given that Sri Lanka has the 64th largest internet user population. But that doen't make the "most searches" claim true.

### 2. 91% of Google Searches in Sri Lanka are for "sex"

If you read the Google Trends Tutorial, you'll understand why this is blatantly FALSE.

### 3. Sri Lanka has a highest proportion of searches for "sex" than any other country, except Ethiopia.

The claim is superficially true. Google's "Interest" value is proportion to the proportion of searches for "sex". Hence, superficially, the claim is TRUE.

However, using the word "sex" as a indicator for "sex" is narrowly English-centric. Other languages have other words for sex.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Rx2swzR8O7FTwhojcWYyfA.png)

Analyzing for "sex" excludes many countries. Including those that speak Spanish and Portugues (both translate as "sexo"), Russian ("секс"), and Chinese ("性別").

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kZLwxJ3lUaRAy9eFdQ4VkA.png)

Also, as you might have noticed, the Chinese word for "sex" does not appear on the map for China. This is because, Google Search is not used in Mainland China. The country with the most number of Internet Users. These users have other search engines, that they might use to search for "sex".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6JRtpNj63wS9QKSDMdFsrQ.png)

There are also hints that searching for "sex" is correlated with a poor knowledge of the English language. For example, internet users looking for pornography in Native-English-Speaking countries, tend to search for "porn" — not "sex".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pkvnGYxemFygmk6GvxCOzQ.png)

Hence, while Sri Lanka clearly has a high proportion of searches for "sex", concluding that Sri Lanka has the highest proportion is, at best, PROBLEMATIC.

### 4. "Sex" is the most searched for term in Sri Lanka.

To correctly answer this question using Google Trends, we would need to compare "sex" to every possible search term.

For example, if we compare "sex" to "Facebook", and "free", we see that until around 2009, "free" was the most popular term (not absolutely, but relative to "sex" and "Facebook"). Then, until about 2015 it was "Facebook". And since then "sex". It is true that, currently, "sex" is more searched for, than "Facebook" and "free". But that doesn't mean that there is no other word that is more popular.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*INWIENFVKCB7jumum6gHVA.png)

Hence, on ""Sex" is the most searched for term in Sri Lanka.", our conclusion should be DON'T KNOW.

## Concluding Thoughts

Regardless of what I've said above, Sri Lanka does have an abnormally high number of searches for sex. Why might that be?

One theory is that a disproportionate number of Sri Lankan internet users are young males. Who are the target audience of most pornagraphic sites. Who, for various cultural and social regions have restricted access to "offline" sex. And who have little education on sex in general, and "sex on the internet" in particular.

There is some (weak) evidence to support this.

For example, the interest in "sex" across Provinces in Sri Lanka, are (weakly) correlated with the proportion of the population aged 20–29.

Note, this "evidence" is, at best, weak. And needs more analysis. It would have been useful if Google Trends broke down its "interest" values by age and gender. Sadly it doesn't.
