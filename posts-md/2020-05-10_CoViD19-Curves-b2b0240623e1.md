### A Simplistic Summary of the Global CoViD19 Situation

If you are like me, you're probably overwhelmed with zillions of numbers, stats and dashboards about CoViD19. The goal of this article is to attempt a cure.

I create "A Simplistic Summary of the Global CoViD19 Situation", by doing the following

* For all countries (with at least 30 confirmed CoViD19 cases as of May 8), I plot the number of active cases, from the time active cases hit 30.

* For better visualization, I cluster countries by shape.

For simplicity, I chose five clusters. Here are the results.

## Cluster 1 (Looking Great)

## Cluster 2 (Looking Good, but too early to celebrate)

## Huge Concluding Disclaimers

As I said, this is a simplistic summary. It hides valuable information like the "absolute number of active cases", or the " number of active cases per capital". Hence view with the appropriate pinch of salt.
