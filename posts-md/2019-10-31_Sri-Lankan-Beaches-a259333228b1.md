# Sri Lankan Beaches

### A Rough Guide

[I originally wrote this article in 2016, and shared it amongst friends on Facebook]

Friends have often asked me what the best beaches in Sri Lanka are. So, I'm writing this short note, with some quick thoughts on the topic. "Best" obviously depends on what you are looking for.

Sri Lanka is a small country, but there's a fair variation in the types of beaches and seaside experiences. I've taken a shot at roughly categorising some of my favourite beaches into 4 regional groups.

### Important Caveats

* I'm not a "travel-expert" so take this with a pinch of salt, but hopefully this will be useful

* The general "bar" on Sri Lankan beaches is quite high — you could pick one of the beaches below at random, and there's a good chance you'll like it.

* Sri Lanka is not a "beaches only" destination. Our history goes back well beyond 2500 years, there's a huge amount of bio-diversity, and breathtaking mountains and waterfalls. There's a lot to experience beyond beaches.

* My "regional groupings" don't include the North-West, North and North-East of the country. This is not because these regions don't have beautiful beaches, but because resort infrastructure is not as developed. This is likely to change in the future.

* The places mentioned below is not exhaustive, and is only a sample.

## East Coast (Arugam Bay, Pasikuda, Nilaweli, Tricomalee)

PROS: Most Beautiful Beaches in the country — white sand makes the sea look bright blue IMHO, shallow water — you can wade out to sea for long distances. Quieter, more private beaches. Surfing (Arugam Bay)

CONS: 6+ hour travel from Colombo by Car.
