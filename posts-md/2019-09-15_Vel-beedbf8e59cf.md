### The sense of nothing and everything

I found myself in,

By a series of by chance,

Events and therein,

(Accidents of circumstance),

Of Adi-Vel. And sights within.

...

Sounds were a carpet,

Not one sound, but many sounds

Drum and trumpet,

A spectrum of tone compounds,

Melodies shone on garnet.

...

And as the sounds like

Red, Green, Orange, Yellow, Blue,

A palette of psych,

A universal mind hue,

Varied and dreamlike.

...

And incense and oil,

Gingerly and coconut

Pantheon of voile,

Ripening fruits. Fresh and cut

An offering of turmoil.

...

Why so different?

From a Chopinesque nocturne,

Escoffier scent,

Or a Monet water fern?

Why so completely diff'rent?

...

And so I thought shear,

Only to then realise,

The diff'rence was clear

For one made me think sidewise,

For one Thought would disappear.

...

Motif in Chopin,

Or a star in a Monet

Just as an omen,

The taste of a hidden spray,

In each one, thought would home in.

...

Narrowing to nought.

But the other had no thought,

An expansion fought,

Mind and universe unsought,

The eternal realm unthought.
