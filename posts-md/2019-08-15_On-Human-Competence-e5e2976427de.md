# On Human Competence

### What humans can do, but machines can't

In [1], I defined Human Competence as:

>>> "the set of all problems that machines cannot solve, but humans can"

I concluded this article by asking:

>>> "What are the properties of Human Competence?"

The goal of this article is to answer this question.

## How humans think

Humans think in two ways: "Thinking" and "Contemplating".

Thinking is a very conscious act. It involves solving some specific problem, that is well defined. For example, "What route should I take to the office this morning?". Thinking consists of following a set of deductions, or inductions that lead to the solution. It is easy to measure progress on solving the problem, on how optimal the answer is, and the extent of the error. While thinking involves facts, opinions and memories, the process of thinking reduces these to something simple. You might know all the roads in Colombo, but finding your route to the office involves narrowing this down to a much smaller subset.

Contemplation, on the other hand, is a mostly sub-conscious process, in that we aren't aware of what's going on. Contemplation also solves problems that are not defined, or that we are not consciously trying to solve. Contemplation often leads to creative composition. For example, poets often describe the process of writing the poem as "the poem writing the poem", while the poet is an external observer. There are few parameters or constraints that defined "rightness", and Optimality and error are ambigous.

## How machines think (and why machines can't contemplate)

Computers have two fundamental abilities:

* The ability to input, store, and output data.

* The ability to process stored data, according to a set of instructions, which are usually also encoded in stored data

While the results of instructions might be complex and emergent, they are still deterministic and human-defined. Hence, computers "solve problems" in a similar way to how people, "think". They follow a path until they get to a solution, or near enough to it.

There are two reasons why machines cannot contemplate:

* Humans don't precisely know what contemplation is. We know that it is probably some complex interactions within our brains, and that interaction involves the complex storage system that is the brain. But our knowledge of this is weak, and we have little sense of how to replicate this within computers.

* Within our brains we perform this complex form of reflection, which we call "consciousness". Consciousness leads to other concepts like "needs", "meaning", "value" and "good". These values drive how humans behave, ultimately control the world, and determine how we contemplate. How the consciousness of individual humans impacts the world is asymmetric; powerful humans have more influence than weaker ones. Hence, in a world where computers don't have social, economic, or political power, they cannot influence values, and thus, contemplation.

In summary, there is a possibility that machines will be able to mimic and surpass the human brains storage mechanisms and the ability to contemplate. But as long as machines don't influence values, they have no direction for contemplation.

## How humans act

Humans don't only think; we also act. And there are various problems that humans solve by "acting" which machines cannot solve.

I'm going to gloss-over this class of problems because they seem more obvious. For me, acts that require "human contact" or the "human touch" (from nursing to personal training)

## What next

Hence, "the set of all problems that machines cannot solve, but humans can" or Human Competence, consists of:

* Contemplative thought

* Acts requiring the human touch

In future articles, I hope to address,

* In what specific situations can humans solve problems better than machines?"

* How might we adapt our education systems, and other institutions and processes, to focus on nurturing Human Competence?

* How can we use technology to foster Human Competence? Or in other words, how might Artificial Competence support Human Competence?
