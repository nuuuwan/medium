# How not to pick a President

### On Cognitive Biases

>>> Who will be the next president of Sri Lanka?

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa recently announced his candidature from the SLPP [1], and there is some parallel speculation on who will contest from the UNP.

And while political high-ups make their decisions, there is also a lot of talk and gossip amongst "ordinary voters" on who should be the president, and how they should vote.

>>> But, how does one decide?

## How we should decide

Picking a president is a complex decision. The rational thing to do would be something like the following:

* Collect as much information about the candidate's record and those of their affiliates

* Project it into the future

* Consider its implications for the country.

It is convenient to "visualize" this information among two dimensions:

* Good Outcomes vs Bad Outcomes

* Voluntary vs Involuntary

We want a president whose actions will result in "Good Outcomes" as opposed to "Bad Outcomes". At the same time, we'd prefer these "Good Outcomes" to arise from voluntary good deeds and policies, as opposed to luck. Hence, for each candidate, we find as much information about the four quadrants of the two-dimensional picture. Then, we base our decision off that.

## How we actually decide

But let me confess: I don't know anyone in Sri Lanka (or any other country, for that matter) who has picked a president (or head-of-state) using this "algorithm".

In reality, our "algorithm" is far simpler, and sadly stupider. Here are some ways in which we actually decide.

### Extreme Event Bias

While a candidate might have done and caused many things, many people vote (or don't vote) for them based on one extreme event.

For example, many people voted for Mahinda Rajapakse purely on the basis that he "won the war". Similarly, many people voted against George W. Bush because he (somehow) "caused 9/11".

This bias towards extremes and forgetting the middle (as most biases), derives from our instinct to be risk-averse, which itself stems from our need to survive.

### Anchor Bias

"Anchoring" consists of choosing a candidate based on some factor that has little to do with the candidate.

For example, in Sri Lanka, much the electorate picks a candidate based, not on policy or record, but party ("කැපුවත් කොළ" or "කැපුවත් නිල්" or "කැපුවත් රතු" types). Another standard anchor is "who my family votes for".

In a stranger case of anchoring, a cousin of mine voted for one party, because her husband voted for the other party. Her logic was not actually antipathy towards her spouse, but a sort of "vote hedging". This sort of "negative-anchoring" is as irrational as the "positive" variety.

### Familiarity Bias

Posters, placards and paper handouts are frequent during election season and even off-season. Candidates also clamour for prime-time TV minutes, and our increasingly spending more money on social media advertising.

These tactics play straight into a common voter bias. Voters are more likely to vote for a "familiar" candidate, regardless of who they are or what they will do.

### Sunk Cost Bias

Suppose you voted for some candidate. Then, suppose that the candidate performed abysmally in their term in office. What will you do in the next election?

The rational thing to do would be to vote for someone else. But that would make your first decision a "stupid decision". It would make you look "stupid".

So you post-rationalize some vague justification that the candidate's term was actually "not too bad". And you vote for them again.

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples of many cognitive biases. You can learn about more in [2].

All voters are guilty of these cognitive biases, to some extent, and politicians know and exploit them. The antidote to prejudice is awareness; to be mindful of our propensity to err, and correct ourselves when we do.

So if there is one thing you'll take away from this article, ask yourself this:

>>> "Why have I picked this candidate? Is this a rational decision, or do cognitive biases overly influence me?"
