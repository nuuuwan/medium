### A Thought Experiment

Recently, I saw a 2020 Election Map of the US, with each state coloured by its winning presidential candidate, assuming that "I didn't vote" was also a candidate.

This led me to ask the following question:

If "didn't vote + rejected votes" was a single political party (let's call it the "Sri Lanka Ghost Party"), how many seats would it have won at #GenElecSL2020Â ?

In this article, I hope to answer this question, and also how many seats the Ghost Party would win in previous elections.

## 2020

Let's recall the actual result of the 2020 General Election. The SLPP won 145 seats; just shy of a â…” majority.

The turnout in 2020 island-wide was ~76%. Of the 16,263,885 registered voters, 12,343,302 cast votes. In other words, 3,920,583 voters didn't cast their ballots. Of the votes cast, 744,373 or ~6% were rejected.

Now suppose we assign the 744,373 rejected votes and the 3,920,583 "I didn't vote"-votes, to an imaginary "Sri Lanka Ghost Party" (ðŸ‘» or "GP"). How many seats would this party win?

The Ghost Party would end up winning 67 seats or just under 30% of the seats in Parliament. The SLPP's vote tally would go down from 145 to 104; still a plurality, but no majority. The SJB's would drop from 54 to 41. Hence, the Ghost Party would have the second-highest number of seats in Parliament, next to the SLPP.

How would these results look like by Electoral District?

In five districts (Jaffna, Vanni, Batticaloa, Digamadulla, and Puttalam), the GP would have the highest number of seats.

Are 67 seats too high? Too low? How does it compare to history?

## 2015

While turnout and rejected votes in 2015 wasn't much different to 2020 (78%, 4.4%), there was a stronger and closer content between the two major parties. In this election, hence, the GP is in third place. It still wins a similar number of seats (65) to 2020.

As we shall see, 2015 is an anomaly, in that it is the only General Election year where the Ghost Party is in third place.

## 2010 andÂ 1989

Similar to 2020, the UPFA won a near â…” majority in 2010, with 144 seats. Unlike 2020, however, turnout was significantly lower (61% compared to 76%). Rejected votes were also higher at 7% (compared to 6%).

In our hypothetical scenario, the GP wins 111 seats, ahead of the UPFA (76 seats) and the UNP (32 seats). It wins first place in all districts, except Gampaha, Hambantota and Digamadulla.

This 111 seats is not unlike 1989, where the GP wins 96 seats. Like 2010, turnout was low (64%) and rejected votes (6%) similar. Unlike 2010, the UNP would win more districts in 1989 than the UPFA in 2010.

## 2005, 2001 andÂ 1994

In 2005, the Ghost Party would come second with 65 seats. Like 2020. Turnout was similar to 2020 at 76% and rejected votes around 5%.

2001 and 1994 would be similar.

[Apologies for not including 2000. I don't have accurate data in rejected votes.]

## Concluding Thoughts

The "Ghost Party" is not real, and the above "analysis" is a thought experiment. Nevertheless, is there something we can learn from this?

A few things:

* Given normal turnout (mid-to-high seventies percentage-wise), the Ghost Party would win about 65 seats. Similar to what it would win in 2020. A fairly "normal" pattern.

* Ghost Party seats are, in theory, up-for-grabs. Real political parties should think hard on how to win these, especially in districts where the Ghost Party seems strong.

* Sri Lanka has a comparatively high turnout compared to many other countries. Hence, "the hunt for Ghost Party's votes" might not be that easy.

* Of the last 7 General Elections (excluding 2000â€Šâ€”â€Šfor which I'm missing some data), the Ghost Party came first in two(1989, 2010), second in four (1994, 2001, 2004, and 2020) and third in one (2015). When the Ghost Party comes second (which is the most common outcome), most of the "floating vote" either votes for the party coming first, or stays home (i.e. "votes" for the Ghost Party), implying that political parties should pay more attention to floating voters.

Happy Hunting! Or should I say, Haunting?
