# On Pain and Pleasure

### From Philosophy to Calculus

### Philosophy in a time of influenza

Do you remember the last time you got the flu? I had an attack of flu some months ago.

The first day was bad. I had a temperature. Sore throat. Cough. Dull headache. It was difficult to sleep. Nor did I feel up to reading a book, or listening to something. I had no appetite to speak of. As I said, it felt pretty bad. That was the first day.

But it's the second day I want to talk about. Or more specifically, the evening of the second day. Because on the evening of the second day, I was beginning to feel a bit better.

I was still quite sick and weak. The mercury was not quite back to normal, and I coughed a lot. But I had the first indications that the disease was on its way out. I felt better. And oddly, clearly better than I was before I got sick in the first place — when I was "not sick". I felt pleasure, optimism, gratefulness, and the overwhelming sense that things were going to get better, not just with my health, but with life in general.

Pain and pleasure are like the first and second days of flu; completely relative. You feel pleasure if what you felt before was worse. And you feel pain, if what you felt before was better. Hence, there is a limit to the amount of pain and pleasure you can feel. For after a couple of days, "feeling good" becomes pleasure-less, boring and meaningless, and perhaps even annoying. Conversely, while "feeling bad" might painful and hard to deal with at first, but soon becomes bearable as time goes on.

### Calculus in a time of procrastination

* So, if what you feel at time t is f(t), you will feel pain if f(t) - f(t-1) is negative, and pleasure if it is positive. In the notation of calculus, pleasure = df/dt. Or equivalently, pain = -df/dt.

* For constant pleasure (a), what you feel must uniformly get better (df/dt = a implies f = at + b). The amount of pleasure is independent of the base feeling (b) from where you started. You can feel bad initially (b < 0), but experience pleasure (df/dt > 0), if how you feel is getting better (a > 0).

* Pain and pleasure are consequences of time, and more specifically memory. If you have no memory of how you felt in the recent past, pain and pleasure are meaningless. In calculus-speak, df/dt cannot be defined if f is not continuous.

* If you are focusing single mindedly at the present moment, ignoring past and future, you can't feel pain or pleasure. You are measuring f at a single point of time, and hence df/dt has no meaning.

* Pain and pleasure are consequences of feeling. Feeling is often subjective, and can change course suddenly. For example, we might be feeling increasingly worse, and then something sudden happens, and we start feeling increasingly better. There is no pain or pleasure at the "cusp" at which this change happens. In other words, df/dt cannot be defined if f is not differentiable.

* If you want to feel a constant level of pleasure (df/dt = a), you need to find ways to constantly feel better and better (f = at + b). In the real world "better and better" requires more and more material goods, in turn requiring constant economic growth.

* The only level of pleasure which is growth neutral is zero. This coincides with no change in feeling. In other words, df/dt = 0 implies f = b (constant).

* The routines of most people are fairly constant, as is the way they feel. Most people attempt to embellish this even-keel with bursts of "feeling better" (E.g. Entertainments, Vacations, Affairs etc). Each of these episodes are characterized by pleasure (with the "feeling better" burst), neutral feeling (when feeling plateaus, "maxima" in calculus-speak), and then pain (when things go back to normal). Hence, pleasure is borrowed in return for future pain. If your goal is extreme pleasure, you need to be prepared and acquire a taste for extreme pain.

* Conversely, when things "hit bottom" (lowest level of feeling, "minima" in calculus-speak), pleasure is just around the corner.

* While "feeling" often has real meaning, pain and pleasure have little meaning in isolation; just the absolute state of the economy has more meaning than the economic growth rate in isolation. For example, Iraq had a GDP growth rate of over 50% in 2004[2], while Japan's growth rate has been almost "stagnant" for a generation [3]. The question is whether you'd like to be Iraq or Japan.
