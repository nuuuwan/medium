### A guide to describing locations in Sri Lanka

## Addresses, Provinces and Districts

The president of Sri Lanka lives at, 01 Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01

[For those who don't read Sinhala, "Janadhipathi Mawatha" means "President Avenue"].

"Colombo 01" denotes the "Colombo Fort" neighbourhood of Colombo, and is part of the Colombo District, which is, itself, part of the Western Province, one of Sri Lanka's 9 provinces.

But there are other ways of describing where the president lives.

## Post Codes

"Colombo 01" can be alternatively referred to by the post code "00100". These five-digit post codes were first introduced in 1997.

[I couldn't find an official list of Sri Lankan Post Codes. The most comprehensive list had 64 unique post codes in the Colombo District.]

Hence, the president lives in the 00100 post code area.

## Local Government Divisions

After the central government, and provincial governments, local governments are the third and lowest level of government in Sri Lanka, and were introduced in the 13th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka in 1987.

Local government is divided into three different groups:

* Municipal Councils (මහ නගර සභා)

* Urban Councils (නගර සභා)

* Divisional Councils (ප්‍රාදේශීය සභා).

The Western province consists of 49 local government divisions, of which 13 are in the Colombo District. Of these 13, Five are Municipal Councils (Colombo, Dehiwala Mount-Lavinia, Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte, Kaduwela, Moratuwa), five are Urban Councils (Kolonnawa, Seethawakapura, Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Kesbewa), and three are Divisional Councils Kolonnawa(Homagama, Kotikawatta Mulleriyawa, Seethawaka).

The president's house is located in the Colombo Municipal Council's governance area.

## Administrative Divisions

Districts in Sri Lanka are also divided into administrative divisions known as Divisional Secretariat Divisions, or DSDs. Some of these administrative divisions date back to feudal counties, the korales and ratas of the Sinhala kings. Sri Lanka has 331 DSDs, of which 13 are in the Colombo District.

DSDs are further divided into Grama Niladaari Divisions (GNDs). The 13 DSDs in the Colombo District are divided into 566 Grama Niladaari Divisions.

The president's house is in the Fort GND, which is part of the Colombo DSD, which itself is part of the Colombo District.

## Electoral Divisions

While Sri Lanka has 25 administrative districts, it has 22 electoral districts, following the 1978 Constitution. The 22 electoral districts mirror the 25 administrative district exactly, except in the case of the Jaffna electoral district (which consists of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi administrative districts), and the Vanni electoral district (which consists of the Mannar, Mulativu, and Vavuniya administrative districts).

The Colombo administrative districts is the same as the Colombo electoral districts. And hence, the president's house is also located in the Colombo electoral district.

Each electoral district is divided into polling divisions. Sri lanka's 22 electoral districts have a total of 160 polling divisions. The Colombo electoral district consists of 15 polling divisions, of which the president's house is located in the Colombo Central polling division.

## Bonus Division: Phone Codes

The Presidential Secretariat's phone number is 011 2354354, which begins with a 011 Colombo phone code.

Sri Lanka has 29 regional phone codes, which roughly correspond to districts. Some districts have more than one phone code. For example, Gampaha district has two phone codes: 033 for Gampaha and 031 for Negombo. The 036 phone code for Avissawella spans both the Colombo and Kegalle Districts, and hence both the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces.

## Disclaimer

This article is based on several data sources, which might be out of date. Please comment if you notice any discrepencies.

I'm also looking for more detailed data that will answer questions like,

* Does a Grama Niladhari Division span multiple Local Government Divisions?

* What is the relationship between post codes and administrative divisions?

* What is the relationship between local government divisions, administrative divisions, and polling divisions?

Stay tuned for updates!
