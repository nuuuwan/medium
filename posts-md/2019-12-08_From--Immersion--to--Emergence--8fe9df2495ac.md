# From "Immersion" to "Emergence"

### On Data Science Blogs, Writing and Peter Thiel

## Data Science Blogs

How do you write a good data science blog?

I used to think that "every good data science blog, starts with a good data science question". For example, I started "On Floating Voters" with a question. "What proportion of Sri Lankan voters are floating voters"? And the rest of the blog was about answering that "good" question.

But this is not entirely true. That's not quite how that blog began. It had far more humble origins.

It began when I got my hands on some data related to elections. I started "playing about" with the data. First on a spreadsheet, then with Python. And then by creating some charts and visualisations. In this way, I "immersed" myself in various pieces of data related to the elections. And the question about floating voters "emerged".

## Writing

There is a problem with "good questions that everyone knows". They belong to one of two types. Either they are "good questions, to which a good answer is impossible". Like "is there a safe and cheap way to perform fusion reactions". They don't have good answers. Or else they are actually "bad questions, disguised as good ones".

Hence, the only way to find good questions is to find good questions that no one knows. The problem with this is that "you" are part of "everyone". So, you also don't know. But that's the idea. You look for questions that you don't know.

How do you do that? You immerse yourself in as much data. Books, pictures, movies, songs. Whatever it takes. And a "good question" will emerge.

What information that one consumes consciously, one digests subconsciously. Not necessarily happen in "real-time". The subconscious is generally slow and takes time. That is why you get up in the morning and suddenly find that you have a great idea. On a side note, if you want to have good ideas, or "be creative", make sure you get plenty of sleep.

This "immersion" to "emergence" process is not unique to Data Science Blog Writing. It is how all great works of writing emerge. One immerses oneself, and great work will emerge. The poem will write the poem. The novel will write the novel. The writing will write the writing.

## Peter Thiel

How do you come up with that killer startup idea? The "next Google"?

In Zero-To-One, Peter Thiel talks about Indian Restaurants in Silicon Valley. And how most of them fail. Founders assume that people are asking "How do I find great Indian food?". When people are actually asking "How do I find good Indian good, across the dozens of potentially crappy Indian Restaurants across Silicon Valley?"

Thiel asks "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" Or to re-phrase "To what good question do you have a good answer, which no one else knows?"

So how do you find a good question that no one else knows?

Startups rarely start with the right "good question". Instead, they start with something, iterate, and something emerges. Hence, startups also follow an "immerse" and "emerge" tactic. The best startups are not the ones with the best idea. They are the ones that are most efficient at making a good idea "emerge". That's why the personalities of founders are far more critical than "the idea".

Hence, data science blogs, writing and startups are all the same. To be successful, you need to immerse, and something good will emerge.
