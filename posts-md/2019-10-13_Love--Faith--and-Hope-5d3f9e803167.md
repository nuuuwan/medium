# Faith, Hope, Love

### On Metta, Karuna, Mudita, and Upekkha

I first saw it in 2007. Over 109 years after its completion.

It is best seen in the moonlight. Like many sandstone buildings. With its carved flowers, sculptured angels, and curving three of life. The shortage of tourists at night means that one can also enjoy in peace. Instead of being poked in the eye. With a selfie stick.

Mosaics of love, faith, hope, and charity adorn the facade of the Stanford Memorial Church.

## Paul

In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul says:

>>> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal resounding in the wind. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and can understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have faith, that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I give all I possess to the poor, and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.

>>> Love is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

>>> Love has no fear; it does not worry; love keeps no records of wrongs; never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.

>>> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

>>> And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

## Love in the time of uncertaintly

Much literature and theology refer to love, faith and hope. But few attempt to define them. That is left to philosophers.

Reflecting, I noticed an uncanny resemblance between these terms, and what I wrote in Love in the time of uncertainty.

### Love: Your bad time is my bad time. Your good time is my good time

>>> Since bad times are a result of uncertainty, the cause of your bad times is the same as the cause of my bad times.

>>> If some bad time befell you, it is only a matter of time before something similar happens to me. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat your bad time as your problem, and not my problem.

The rationale is the same for good time.

### Faith: In good times and bad

>>> If everything is uncertain, then there is no difference between good times and bad times. Random uncertainty causes both. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat you one way or another way all because times are good, or times are bad.

### Hope: May you and I have good times

>>> If everything is uncertain, there is no point pretending that the future will be good or bad. But why not hope for the best? And not just for me, but equally for you also?

And similarly, the resemblance to the four Brahmaviharas is also unmistakable: Hope is Metta. Love is Karuna and Mudita. Faith is Upekkha
