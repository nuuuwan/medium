# Our War

War began not suddenly, but yet suddenlyIt was expected, yet it was unexpectedSickening and bringing out all the hate in the worldIt raged while it raged. But not afterFor as soon as it began it ended(An Anticlimax)I think we both wanted it (the war) to last — but it was not to beEven though we were poised...

Guns were all a ready to fire, ammunition loaded, crowds shouting for blood..But nothing really happenedA few fake skirmishes.That was all.Looking back, really nothing.

Nothing at all.

But then againIt was a sort of war, wasn't it?It did happen, didn't it?It must have. For...we still feel it, don't we?
