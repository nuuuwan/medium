### Prologue

In German, "Spiegel im Spiegel" means "mirror in the mirror" or "mirrors in the mirror" or "Infinity Mirror". You may recognize it as the title of the Estonian composer Arvo Part's famous tintinnabular (bell-like) composition for Piano and Violin [1][2].

This article is not about music; though it is about mirrors.

## On Mirrors

I'm walking along one of those long corridors one meets at hotels. On one side of the corridor are doors, lamps, pictures, and an array of ornaments. All along the other-side is a mirror.

I'm supposed to attend an event somewhere in the hotel. The receptionist has asked me to enter through the last door, at the end of the corridor. Not paying much attention to the paintings and the ornaments, I walk on. When I reach the end of the corridor, I turn, and reach out my hand to open the door.

Moments before I expect it, my knuckles hit a hard surface. It is painful, also slightly cold. I narrowly save my forehead from the same fate.

All along, I've mistaken the reflection of the doors, lamps, pictures, and ornaments, for the real thing. And the real thing, for the reflection. Perhaps, one ornament, or painting, looked real. And I decided to consider everything real.

A moment before I walk through the (real) door, I look over my shoulder at my own reflection.

## On the Mirror of Reality

In Every thing we think is wrong. And that's ok.[3] I said:

>>> The world we perceive is a model — constructed by our brains. For example, while we think we can "see in real time", that "realtime streaming video" is actually constructed from a set of still snapshots (about 10 per second), and then expertly stitched together by our brain — creating an illusion of continuity. All models are always incomplete, and often inaccurate — which is what I meant by "wrong".

>>> So, if all models are wrong, and our perception of the world is a model, everything we think and feel is wrong. But happily, as Box implied, some things we think are also useful.

Hence, our minds are mirrors that reflect a model of reality that is (hopefully) useful to us. When we perceive a belt as a snake [3], or a mosquito as "The Enemy" [4], we are seeing the world through a mirror.

And what about us? Do we not also see ourselves through this mirror that is our mind? Is there any other way of seeing ourselves?

Or have we somehow convinced ourselves that we are, for some reason, outside the mirror? On the real side?

What are the real consequences of us being on the imaginery side of the mirror? What real thing is the mirror reflecting? And what are the consequences of the mirror itself being on the imaginery side of the mirror?

What does this recursive gobbledegook even mean?

## The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side

The mirror of thought is a mechanism for transforming concrete things into abstract and relative things. This process of transforming has no innate meaning of its own, except that it has helped humans (and possibly other intelligent organisms) survive.

It is difficult to see beyond, and see through the mirror, or even see the mirror itself, if the only means of seeing involves the mirror as a source of reflection. The only way is to stop looking (so thoroughly and keenly) at the mirror, and seeking other modes of sight.

But what other means of sight?
