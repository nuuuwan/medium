# The Arrogance Tax

### On how to deal with arrogant people

An arrogant person has an exaggerated opinion of their own abilities. However, "exaggerated" rarely translates into "inaccurate". Arrogant people are often smart, skilled and driven, and often have much to contribute. It's just that the "exaggeration" means that there is a difference (a "delta") between their actual value and their "self-advertised" value.

```
"Arrogance Tax" = "Self-Advertised Value" - "Actual Value"
```

This difference is the "Arrogance Tax".

If we are to work with arrogant people, we have no choice but to pay the Arrogance Tax, which might come in the form of patience, resilience, humility, and persuading others to also pay the tax.

As with any tax, whether or not we decide to pay it, depends on whether the tax is worth paying. If the difference of value between the arrogant person and the next best option is more than the tax, then it is probably worth paying.

Obviously, we can't objectively measure "Arrogance Tax" with any quantitative accuracy. It is a highly subjective "judgement call", at best "qualitative". Hence, that is how you should interpret this article: qualitatively, not quantitatively.

To summarise, if there is a qualitative justification for paying the "Arrogance Tax", we should work with the arrogant person.
