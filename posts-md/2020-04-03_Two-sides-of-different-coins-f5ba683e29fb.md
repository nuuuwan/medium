### On Justice and Karma.

Alice punched Bob in the face. Policeman Charlie locked Alice up for seven days; the punishment for punching Bobs. Justice!

Bob earned a black-eye, and Alice a jail-term. But was that all that happened? Not quite.

One might have expected Alice to show some remorse. But no. True — she had not enjoyed her week in chokey. But she did enjoy the punch, and Bob's subsequent dazed look. And the unique hue of blue and black that emerged, a few days later, around Bob's left eye.

No. Alice enjoyed the episode. She hadn't had this much fun in years.

But something else also happened.

The next week when Alice met Daisy, she noticed that she wanted to punch her in the face too. Even harder than she had hit Bob. Knock her block off proper. And so she did.

This time Alice earned a full month in jail. And three months of community service afterwards. And, on top of all this, a fine.

What did Alice feel about it? She felt magnificent. The attack on Daisy was a significant improvement compared to last time. Daisy had received, not one, but two black eyes. Alice had also succeeded in partially dislodging Daisy's upper right canine. She had never felt better.

Was Alice going mad? Did she need psychiatric help? Her defence seemed to think so. Maybe they were right. I don't know.

But what if things got worse? What if this need to punch people completely took-over Alice's entire personality? What if Alice became the people puncher? Karma!
