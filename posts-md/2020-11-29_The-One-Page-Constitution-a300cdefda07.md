### The Constitution of Sri Lanka

# The One Page Constitution

### A Thought Experiment

Most nations have constitutions that are hundreds of pages long. For example, the 2015 Revision of the Sri Lankan Constitution (up to and including the 19th amendment) contains 242 pages.

But what if we could write a constitution that fitted on a single page? One that could be read in a couple of minutes?

This article is a (possibly foolhardy and naive) attempt at such a "One Page Constitution" for Sri Lanka. I've erred on the side of being "novel and imaginative" and my "one-pager" has obvious weaknesses and gaps.

But then this is a thought experiment intended to be thought-provoking, while not necessarily practical.

## The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

### Article 1: Moderation of Power

* Bill Of Fundamental Rights, will ensure the most basic freedoms and rights of people (citizens and non-citizens) within the country, including freedom of speech, religion, press, and assembly, and freedom from cruel punishment etc.

* Legislature and "Representatives": Parliament will consist of a lower house and upper house, and will be responsible for only legislation, not execution. The Lower house, will be elected by the people, and will design and vote on laws. The Upper house, appointed by the lower house, with guaranteed membership for women, religious and ethnic minorities, and technocrats, will have veto power on all laws. Appointments to both houses are for four-year terms, and have a retirement age of 75.

* Judiciary: Nominated by Parliament, with a retirement age of 75.

* Executive: The posts of Executive President and Prime Minister are abolished. See Technocratic Executive below.

### Article 2: Stability of Laws

* Consistency: No law or its execution may contradict another law. Laws must be mutually consistent. E.g. No religion may trespass on a person's freedom of religion.

* Amendments: Amendment to this constitution would require the approval of 75% of both Lower and Upper houses.

### Article 3: Simplicity of Representation

* Lower house Representatives will be elected by First-past-the-post voting, from polling divisions ("Constituencies"), ensuring that each citizen knows exactly who their representative is.

* Local and Provisional Governments are abolished. The Lower House Representatives will also be responsible for local and provincial matters of their constituencies.

* Parliamentary Terms will begin on the first working day of January of years divisible by 4 (2000, 2004, 2008 etc.). Elections will be held on the first Saturday of December the previous year.

### Article 4: Efficiency of Execution

* Technocratic Executive: The executive will be headed and staffed by career technocrats. Parliament will pass legislation that determines budgets, policy, accountability and goals for the executive.

* Decentralization: Every service supplied by the State (Health, Education, Utilities, Transport, Police etc.), will be administered at the smallest practicable unit. E.g. Local Roads and Schools can be administered at the Constituency level; Coast Guard at the National Level.

* English will be the official language.

### Article 5: Identity of The Nation

* The Head of State will be a Non-Executive President, appointed by Parliament, embodying values considered most Sri Lankan, for life or until retirement.

* National Symbols (Anthems, Flags, Holidays) will amalgamate components from all identity groups. E.g. There won't be a Sinhala National Anthem or a Tamil National Anthem, but instead a Sri Lankan National Anthem, with both Sinhala and Tamil (as well as other) components.
