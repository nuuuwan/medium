# The Only Big Match

### A highly sophisticated statistical analysis

"‘Tis the season for Big Matches!"

"Season?", you inquire. "Are there many Big Matches?"

Of course, you're right to be suspcious. While the misinformed amateurs on Wikipedia claim that Sri Lanka has no less than 34 "Big Matches", this claim has been vociferously denied by the experts.

As one twitter pandit explained, and many commentators agreed:

>>> 

Of course, to the calm, unbiased and rational statistician (like, ahem, yours truly), all this "qualitative" banter is hogwash. Mere half wollies and long hops to be hit for six sans mercy. Only "quantitative quantities" (or "numbers" — if you're an unsophisticated tail-ender) matter. And so one wondered, if there was a statistically significant method one could use to answer the "Is the Battle of the Blues the only Big Match?" question.

Or as Ranjit Fernando might have expertly and originally paraphrased:

>>> "One wondered, Nuwan, if there was a statistically significant method one could use to answer the "Is the Battle of the Blues the only Big Match?" question"

## One's Sophisticated Methodology

All statistical analyses begin with a "Null Hypothesis" and an "Alternative Hypothesis". The "Alternative Hypothesis" is the thing that must be tested. The "Null Hypothesis" is the default position we accept if there is no evidence to accept the "Alternative Hypothesis".

Hence, let's begin with our Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

* Null Hypothesis: "The Battle of the Blues is the only Big Match."

* Alternative Hypothesis: "The Battle of the Blues is not the only Big Match."

Now, let's dig into the data.

### Caps

Our School Matches are cousins of Test Matches. So let's consider the question "Which schools did test-match players attend?" The more test-caps, the better the school.

"Why only Test Cricket?", you ask.

As I said, it's about good genes and breeding. School Matches and Test Matches are family. ODI's and (dare I mention it) T20s are pretend love children. At best. Undeserving of profound contemplations and analyses such as this.

One hundred fifty or so male cricketers have represented Sri Lanka in Test Cricket. These are the schools they graced:

We see the "Battle of the Maroons" in front. Followed by the "Battle of the Saints" and the "Battle of the Blues". Hence, there seems to be some evidence that the "Battle of the Maroons" is a Big Match. Of sorts. And, so might the "Battle of the Saints" — though to a much lesser extent.

### Matches

But you retort, "Berty played only one match. And was out first ball in both innings. Why should that count?"

And you are right. We should give more credit to chaps I mean, Caps who have played more matches.

After this adjustment, the "Battle of the Maroons" is still ahead. But let's not jump to conclusions. For I see you inching towards another appeal.

### Runs

"Offside!", you exclaim, "Amarabandu scored many more runs than Bonipace. Why should every match appearance count equally?"

And again, you've caught me one short. Let's look at the total aggregate test runs by the school.

Again, the Maroons seem to be in front.

### Wickets

But, again, I see you waving your hands.

"I want to refer that!", you exclaim. "The Maroons might be good at batting, but aren't they crap at bowling?"

And of course, you are right again.

The Maroons are, indeed, utter balls at flinging crap. I mean, utter crap at flinging balls. And with that last-minute referral, they are marooned to the back of the league table.

And so, we are back to square one. Or square leg, as we say in the trade. Our evidences for any other big match, along with the marooned Maroons, are well and truly stumped.

## Concluding Conclusive Conclusions

And so, what are our profound conclusions?

Based on rigorously analysing a wide range of rigorously complex factors, all genuine quantitative quantities (or "numbers" to the plebs), from Caps to Matches to Runs, to Wickets, we must conclude the following:

There is no statistically significant evidence to accept the Alternative Hypothesis. In other words, there is no evidence to say "The Battle of the Blues is not the only Big Match".

And hence, we must accept the Null Hypothesis. Or in other words (according to the statistics),

"The Battle of the Blues is the only Big Match."

Back to the pavilion, one thinks? Eh Ranjit?
