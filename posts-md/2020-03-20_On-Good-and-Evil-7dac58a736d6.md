# On Good and Evil

### Are there such things?

## Shouting Matches

I was watching one of those YouTube "intellectual shouting matches". An Evangelical Pastor and a Celebrity Atheist each took turns bashing the other.

I hate these "debates" because they are not "constructive". No one gains anything; the speakers nor the audience. It's a popularity contest where one contestant tries to out-poll the other.

"But then why did you watch it?", I hear you ask.

Well, the topic interested me: "Which was "Good and Evil: Does it require God?"

## Common Ground

The Pastor claimed that all good and evil comes from God. And without God, there was no good and evil. The Atheist claimed that humans evolved our sense of good and evil, because it helped us with survival.

Despite disagreeing at high volume, the debaters did agree on somethings things. They agreed on "what good and evil consisted of". For example, both agreed that "theft" and "murder" were evil, or "bad things".

They even agreed on a more fundamental point: That good and evil were conventions; that had no other reason or explanation beyond the convention.

The Theist believed that the convention was "laid down by God" and hence one could not argue with it. The Atheist believed that the convention was a product of evolution; also, uncontroversial. While the Celebrity Atheist described himself as an "Atheist", he did have a sort of god. He was a firm "believer" in "Fact of Evolution", and he was even more devout and assured than the Man of God.

They even agreed on "incentives": or why people wanted to do good things, and not do bad things.

One argued that they wanted to please god, and receive their reward in heaven, post death. God's incentive. The other argued that doing "good things" made them feel pleasure and other good emotions. Evolution's incentive.

## The Golden Rule

So, were there no fundamental things that were "good" or "evil"? Was good and evil only relative to conventions? Either those of this world, or those of the next?

There seems to be one concept of good which is "not relative"; or strictly "not relative to anything else"; because it is relative to itself, though independent of everything else. That concept is "reciprocity"; also known as the "Golden Rule".

Being or doing something is "good" if you believe that the opposite is also good. For example, Alice doing X to Bob is "good", if Alice and Bob are happy with Bob doing X to Alice.

While I tried to "dress-up" the Golden Rule as an "absolute", at some level it is also a convention. Why should one follow it? Is there anything "below" the Golden Rule? Some more fundamental concept that is absolute?

## The Mother of Golden Rules

I don't have a good answer to this question, except that the Golden Rule's innate "recursiveness" gives it some "stability" and "concreteness". While Alice's sense of good could be unstable and arbitrary, joining it with Bob's concept makes it stronger.

This "joining" can be further extended. Whenever we have some concept of good, we could try and "join" it with the concept of good of everyone and everything.

Hence, the ultimate good is what everyone can agree on as good.

## Lost in Ignorance

"But hardly anyone agrees on anything", you lament.

True. And few people will agree on "sense of good" either. The violent disagreement we see between religious and political ideologies are proof of that.

But why do they disagree? Is it because the honestly disagree? Or is it for other reasons? Power, for example? Or even more "powerful" Ignorance?

What would "good and evil" look like, if everyone and everything had no Ignorance?
