# On Self Genesis

### And the twelve days of creation

### The first day

In the beginning, there was nothing, and nothing was there, and there was nothing.

And God said, "Let there be change", and there was change, and all that was there changed. But since there was nothing, nothing changed. Yet all things changed.

But then I said, "I will forsake change, for I'm tired of change — I will stretch out my hand and destroy change".

But I could not destroy change.

And, so, I said, "I will ignore change".

### The second day

All things changed, but I ignored change. But I could not ignore all change.

So, while all things changed, some things did not change, and some things changed.

### The third day

I looked at what did not change, and what did change, and saw that it was good. And I said that it was good.

And I waited for the next time that it was good. And there was time. And with time the next time.

And I said that time was good, that it was a good time.

### The fourth day

I looked at what was good, and saw it had shape, but no name. So I named this shape "name". And, hence, there was name.

And I said that it was a good name.

And I named all that was good, and had shape, with names.

### The fifth day

And all the had shape and name, needed to be seen.

But there was no sight, and all was darkness.

So I said, "Let there be light". And there was light and sight. And all that was good, with shape and name, was seen in the light.

### The sixth day

But light was light, and sight was sight, and a great mountain of compassion spanned between.

So I said, let light touch sight, and sight touch light.

And light touched sight, and sight touched light.

I touched touch and said it was good.

### The seventh day

And when I touched touch, I felt the touch. And it felt good.

And so, on the seventh day, there was feeling.

And it was a good feeling.

And so feeling good, I rested on the seventh day from all my work that I had done.

### The eighth day

But as the day changed, the feeling left me. Light touched no sight. And sight touched no light.

There was no light. And only darkness. And I craved the light and the feeling.

And so, on the day after the sabbath, I craved.

### The ninth day

But there was evening and there was morning, and the day changed again, but light was not in sight, and sight was not in light.

But I craved and said, "I am this craving, and this craving is me. I am, and therefore I am I"

And so on the ninth day, I clung to my craving.

### The tenth day

On the tenth day, I rose.

And as I rose, I said, "I am I, and the only I, and the only I that is I".

And I looked at all there was, and said "I am. The I thy I. Thou shalt not have any strange Is before Me."

### The eleventh day

But on the eleveth day, that which was I, changed. And there was no I. And I died.

I said (in bad Greek), "I am dead. God has killed me".

And as I died, that which was not I, became I. And I saw I.

### The twelfth day

And I saw that I was I. And yet, I was not I.

I was I, and not I.

I had changed. And it was not good.

I looked at all the changed, and said (this time in bad German) "All this is quite unsatisfactory".

And then I said, "I will forsake change, for I'm tired of change — I will stretch out my hand and destroy change".

### Epilogue

But I could not destroy change.

And, so, I said, "I will ignore change"...
