# On Discipline

### In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti

Sri Lankans are supposed to be undisciplined. On the road, where we drive like maniacs. In the workplace, where we are lazy and erratic. Even in parliament, where we are (I'm told) incompetent and corrupt.

Many Sri Lankans also hate undisciplined people, and for this reason, many Sri Lankans hate many other Sri Lankans. The former also pontificate a lot on how to make the latter more disciplined.

In this article, I intend to go one step further. And pontificate on the pontificators.

## The Son

How do you make a manic driver mend their ways? How do you stop them from jumping lanes, running red lights, and horning at every second opportunity?

"You cannot", says the son.

"They have to mend their ways. They have to have consideration, compassion and empathy for their fellow drivers. And until all drivers are like this, our roads will be manic."

"And why should they cultivate consideration, compassion and empathy?", we ask.

"Out of loyalty and gratitude to society", continues the son. "Just as I am loyal and grateful to my father".

The same applies to the workplace and parliament. Workers, out of loyalty and gratitude to their employers, customers and shareholders, should work hard and smart. Politicians, out of loyalty and gratitude to the people, should be honest and competent.

At least, so says the son.

## The Father

But the father disagrees.

"That manic driver will never mend their ways. Unless you give them a bit of stick, like a father disciplines a son", continues the father.

"Drivers have to have fines, and licences taken away at the smallest sign of naughtiness."

And the same applies to workers and politicians. Employees need to be strict. Rules have to be enforced, and laggards fired. Politicians need oversight and must be subjected to a state of law.

"And why does the father discipline the son?", we ask.

"Because that's the only way a system can work. If rules are enforced, like a father disciplining a son", the father concludes.

## The Holy Spirit

Both the father and son have something in common. The son seems to obey arbitrary rules to please the father, and the father enforces arbitrary rules to nurture the son. How "arbitrary," you think these, depend on your personality. If you are a cynic, everything is too arbitrary. If you are an idealist, nothing is.

We are all neither total cynics nor total idealists: We are to varying degrees realists. We all have a sense of son and a touch of father.

And the reality is that we need to think like both father and son at the same time. Without the son, society feels repressed. Without the father, society breaks into anarchy.

Whether road, workplace or parliament, we need to ask two questions: 1) Is the son present to a sufficient degree, and 2) Is the father also present to a sufficient degree? There is no point in expecting discipline if one of there other is missing.

We cannot force employees into working harder or drivers into driving better. Nor can we expect politicians to be honest, if there are no rules to govern them.

We need a spirit of both son and father: a sort middle path — a holy spirit.
