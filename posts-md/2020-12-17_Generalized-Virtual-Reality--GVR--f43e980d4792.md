### On Reality. Virtual and Otherwise

Present Virtual Reality (VR) systems like Facebook's Oculus, are limited and inaccurate; limited because they simulate only some of our senses, mostly sight and sound; inaccurate because these simulations are, at best, approximations. When we look through a VR headset, we know that we are looking through a VR headset. Because images are blotchy and sounds are artificial.

But what if we had "Generalized" VR?

By "Generalized" VR (GVR), I mean a VR system that was unlimited and accurate. Unlimited because it would simulate all our senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, pressure etc. Accurate because it would affect a reality that was so real, that a human wouldn't be able to recognize that it was virtual.

Is GVR possible? And if so, what types of experiences could it credibly simulate? For example, could it simulate the experience a human (say me) walking about some space (say my house)?

If I were walking about my house, I would experience several things. I would see a changing landscape. As I pass a window, I would see the window passing. I would also experience different sounds. As I walk towards the window, the traffic outside would sound louder. If it was a sunny day, I might even feel the heat of the sun through the window. As I walk towards the kitchen, I would smell the aromas of lunch. And so on.

While we are probably years away from systems that can simulate all these experiences, it is still possible to imagine how we might get there.

But is this all that I experience?

There is one thing that I experience while walking around my house, which might be more difficult to simulate. It is the sense of "doing".

An accurate simulation of the sense would give me a realistic experience of being. For example, I'm "being" next to the window. But would a VR system give me the experience of "doing"? For instance, "doing" the act of walking towards the window?

Is it possible to "simulate" the "feeling of doing"?

Believers in "free will" might say "no". But Neuroscience is tending in the direction of a cautious "yes".

Evidence indicates that when I raise my foot, to walk towards the window, the feeling that "I must will my foot to rise" does not precede, but proceeds my foot rising. In other words, my foot rises first, and I post-rationalize the action that I "I willed my foot to rise", or "I raised my foot".

Hence, while I don't know exactly how, it might be possible to induce a sense of "free will" through some electro-chemical hacking of the brain.

All this leads to the much bigger "Matrix" question: Are we already in some GVR system? And if so or if not, how can we know for sure?
