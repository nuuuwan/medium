# West Coast Swing

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

In 2015, the UPFA's Mahinda Rajapaksa won 47.6% of the vote. Or 2.4% behind the magic 50% finish line. To win in 2019, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa needed to gain at least 2.4% of the vote. In electoral jargon, this "gain" is known as the "swing".

## Swing

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's SLPP ended up gaining a swing of about 4.7% island-wide, ending on 52.2%.

While the Northern province swung towards the NDF. The Western, Southern and North-Central provinces swung to the SLPP. The other provinces didn't swing by much.

At an electoral district level, as expected, the Polonnaruwa district swung back to the SLPP. More significantly, the majority of the votes in the swing came from the Colombo, Gampaha, Galle and Matara districts. Hence, a "West Coast Swing".

Zooming further, at a polling division level, it is clear that the swing was densest on the "coast".

## Gains and Holds

In 2015, the NDF won 70 of the 160 polling divisions, to the UPFA's 90. In 2019, the SLPP not only managed to "hold" onto all 90, but also gained 24 polling divisions that the NDF won in 2015.

Among these 24 were all 8 of the "Pure Bellwether" polling divisions. Katana, Ja-Ela, Ratmalana, Moratuwa, Mawathagama, Medirigiriya, Minneriya and Polonnaruwa. The winning candidate in all eight presidential elections has won each of these Bellwethers.

In 2015, the NDF won 12 electoral districts, to the UPFA's 10. In 2019, the SLPP held all 10, and also gained 6: Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy, Badulla, Puttalam and Polonnaruwa. Polonnaruwa remains the sole "Bellwether Electoral District". The winning candidate has won Polonnaruwa in all eight presidential elections.

Zooming out, the SLPP held onto the five provinces that the UPFA won in 2015, and also gained the Western and Central provinces from the NDF.

While "swing" is meaningful, "gains" and "holds" are less meaningful in "non-first-past-the-post" elections. On the other hand, one "gain" is definitely significant. The biggest gain of all.
