# The fork in the road

Easy. The journey thus far. Enjoyable even.

But I see a fork. Why do I want to take the high road?

The low road is so...alien.

Since itself forked off, it has brought me only bliss. And a sort of bliss that can only increase. Not diminish.

But it is alien.

For not once, did I need to look at my watch. Is it time for lunch? Should I take a break? Am I being followed? Not once.

Time seems to have stopped. Or disappeared completely.

Alien.

For not once have I thought about the future or the past.

Those great repositories of all those things that I should have done but didn't do. And should do but won't.

Alien, because it is free of time. And all that comes with time. All that is time.

And I see the fork in the road. And I see that path back to the high road. The high road. With its troubles and pains. That high road of "time".

And I see my self. Uncontrollably. Taking steps toward it.
