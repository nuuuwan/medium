### CoVid19 in Sri Lanka

# Spikes, Active Cases, Predictions and the Future

### Some approximate thoughts

## Spikes

Three spikes dominate the brief history of CoViD19 in Sri Lanka: The "Navy" spike in June. The spike associated with the Kandakadu Drug Rehabilitation Centre, and the latest spike associated with Brandix in Minuwangoda.

Each spike was about double the height of the previous. While this might be a coincidence, it is still worrying. Emotionally, if not rationally.

## Active Cases

While the spikes and the associated "total confirmed cases" have got a lot of media attention, the number that matters is the number of active cases. Our "ability to cope", in terms of hospital staff, beds and ventilators, depends on this latter statistics.

Any spike in new confirmed cases causes a spike in the number of active cases. But as these people recover (or in a few cases die), the number of active cases drop.

## Predictions

The number of active cases at a point of time is the number of confirmed cases minus the number of recoveries and deaths.

The number of recoveries is relatively easy to predict since it seems to follow the number of confirmed cases 21 days ago, reasonably closely — matching our intuition that people recover in about three weeks.

The number of deaths from CoVid10 in Sri Lanka has been mercifully, so far, low compared to other countries. We could also reasonably assume that the "death rate" would stay reasonably stable. Hence, like the number of recovered cases, we could fairly accurately predict the number of deaths based on the recent history of confirmed cases.

The tricky variable is the number of new confirmed cases. This number is hard to predict in general, just as it is hard to predict spikes in particular.

## The Future

Any prediction for the future would depend on our ability to predict new confirmed cases — obviously, difficult. Hence, I'm not going to make any predictions. Instead, I'll make some observations based on a single, hypothetical scenario.

We've had about 100 cases per day, during the last three days (October 10, 11 and 12). There is no reason to assume that this trend will continue. But if we do assume that this trend continues for the next 100 days, the number of confirmed and active cases will be as follows:

At this rate, we would reach nearly 15,000 total confirmed cases in the next 100 days. But, as explained above, the more important metric is active cases.

The number of active cases would peak at around 3,500. Then active cases would "flatten out" at approximately 2100 cases. This is the number of new cases (100) time the days for each cases to recover (21). This computation is crucial because it gives us a sense of the relationship between active cases and new cases.

The latter calculation also gives us a sense of how many "new cases per day we could cope with". This number is the number of "active cases we could cope with" divided by 21. For example, if our maximum capacity for active cases was 2100, we cannot deal with more than 100 new cases per day.

However, before the "flattening out" there will be a peak of active cases. This is when our health care systems will be stressed the most. And what we should worry most about.
