# Love in the time of uncertainty

### Featuring The Black Eyed Peas, Rumi, and à¶´-à¶´ à¶»à¶´Â à¶´-à¶¸à·Š

How does a person treat another person? It usually depends on who the other is. Various cultures have various codes on how to treat various people. Some codes apply to only people close to youâ€Šâ€”â€Šlike friends and family. Some codes extend to even the extremes of peopleâ€Šâ€”â€Šlike criminals and enemies. For example, most cultures look down upon executing surrendering soldiers. Some codes extend beyond the human species to animals and plants.

Codes build upon philosophical ideas and assumptions about the world.

Reciprocity is a common assumption. If we don't execute our enemy's soldiers, they won't execute our soldiers. The Golden Rule generalises this idea:

>>> "Treat others as you would like others to treat you". Or "Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated".

Another assumption is group identity. If you want to belong to a group, you must behave in a certain way. If you ill-treat members of your group, the group will banish you.

Both reciprocity and group identity depend on incentives and enforcement. If one didn't care about banishment, or the group has no power to banish, one could behave with impunity. This is a problem.

Is there a code on how to treat people based on the individual and not the collective? One that comes from within. As opposed to without.

## An individualistic code (from first principles)

As with collectivistic codes, an individualistic code must start somewhere. With some assumptions about the world.

I believe in only one philosophical assumption about the world: Everything is uncertain. People, Ideas, Nations. Everything.

How might we build a code from this principle?

### 1. In good times andÂ bad

If everything is uncertain, then there is no difference between good times and bad times. Random uncertainty causes both. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat you one way or another way all because times are good, or times are bad.

### 2. Your bad time is my badÂ time

Since bad times are a result of uncertainty, the cause of your bad times is the same as the cause of my bad times.

If some bad time befell you, it is only a matter of time before something similar happens to me. Hence, it is unjust for me to treat your bad time as your problem, and not my problem.

As John Donne said,

>>> No man is an island entire of itself....And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

### 3. Your good time is my goodÂ time

Ditto. The rationale is the same as for bad times.

### 4. May you and I have goodÂ times

If everything is uncertain, there is no point pretending that the future will be good or bad. But why not hope for the best? And not just for me, but equally for you also?

With the above, there is the question of what good and bad mean. For a serial killer, murdering babies might be "good". But I don't mean this type of relative good and bad. I mean absolute good and bad. What absolute means is a whole new topic. I have briefly approached it in On Justice and On Freedom from Freedom. For now, I'll assume that you (dear reader) are good enough and your good is good enough for me.

## Where is theÂ love?

You might have noticed that these principles are hardly original. They map closely to the Four Brahmaviharas of Buddhism. However, there is no good English word for "Brahmaviharas". So I'll just call them "Love". Shall I?

And it's not only Buddhism. These same concepts are the core of the Christian Marriage wows, and isn't marriage supposed to be about love?

>>> I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.

Rumi, himself an Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic, describes love much like this:

>>> The garden of love is green without limit and yields many fruits other than sorrow or joy. Love is beyond either condition: without spring, without autumn, it is always fresh.

Even Aristotle referred to the union of the good times and bad times of two people as:

>>> Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.

Hence, my definition justifies, methinks.

## ðŸŽµ à¶´-à¶´ à¶»à¶´ à¶´-à¶¸à·ŠÂ ðŸŽº

But apologies, if you expected something streamy about sexual love or romantic love. You might feel betrayed by my self-definition of love, instead of going with what all the pop-songs are going-on about.

But then, there's a lot more to love. And if we realise this, perhaps most of our problems will go away?

>>> All you need is loveÂ ðŸŽµ à¶´-à¶´ à¶»à¶´ à¶´-à¶¸à·Š ðŸŽº

>>> All you need is loveðŸŽµ à¶´-à¶´ à¶»à¶´ à¶´-à¶¸à·Š ðŸŽº

>>> All you need is love, love

>>> Love is all you need
