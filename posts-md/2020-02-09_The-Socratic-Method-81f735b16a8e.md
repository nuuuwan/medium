# The Socratic Method

### Dumb people have all the answers. Smart people have all the questions.

## My favourite meetings

Like most people, I am not overly fond of meetings. But one type of meeting, I do like. One-on-ones. Meetings I have with one other person.

One-on-ones (1:1s for short) have many benefits. They can be had in informal settings. Like a cafe. Or a park bench. Or even while walking. "On the hoof". They tend to be far more productive. Because the "agenda" must be relevant to both parties. Unlike most large meetings, where one, two or a few people talk. While others twiddle their thumbs, phones. Or sleep.

But one of my favourite benefits of 1:1s is that they are the perfect setting for applying one of the most potent conversational tools: The Socratic Method.

Let me demonstrate.

Suppose I'm having a 1:1 with an engineer that I'm mentoring. She says something like:

>>> "I'd like to be a more productive coder. I'd like to be able to write more code in less time. How might I do that?"

I could reply,

>>> "Use a better IDE [Integrated Development Environment — a tool for writing programming code]. XYZ is excellent."

or

>>> "You should master Git [A tool for maintaining multiple versions of code]. Here are a couple of tips..."

or

>>> "Here's a reading list. Some great books on programming."

or

>>> "Let's do some pair programming [where one programmer codes and the other watches, observing possible mistakes or patterns]. Then, I'll be able to suggest something."

or

>>> "That office chair looks very uncomfortable. Get an ergonomic evaluation and a better posture".

All of these are reasonable answers. But there is a problem. They are answers. But what, you might ask, is the problem with answers? Let me explain.

## The Problem with Answers

To start with, answering a question might be based on or lead to the assumption that the question has only one answer.

For example, my coding mentee might become obsessed about the perfect IDE. And forget about Git, programming books, pair-programming and posture.

But even if I caveat my answer with "this is one of many things you could do", there is a more severe problem. When I answer a question with an answer, there is no "creation of knowledge".

Knowledge passes from one person to another. Between us, there is no new knowledge. Even though one of us might now have more knowledge. The system as a whole, has not gained.

## The Socratic Solution

Alternatively, I could have "answered" the question as follows:

>>> "Why do you want to write more code in a day?"

or

>>> "What makes you think you are not writing enough code?"

or

>>> "How would you describe a "productive coder"?"

When a question answers a question, there is an opportunity for "creating" knowledge. Or "expanding" knowledge.

For example, I get a better sense of why my mentee wants to code more. Or anxieties she might have about not being a good enough coder. Or (possibly flawed) views and opinions she has on what makes a "productive coder". The "correct answer" to her question might have nothing to do with writing more code. It might have something do to with writing smarter code. Or even nothing to do with code at all. The motivation behind the question might be about getting more respect from colleagues. Or a higher salary.

And to my question, my mentee can reply with yet another question. The "Socratic Method" refers to this type of cooperative conversation. Based on questions and constructive argument.

The Greek Philosopher Socrates loved asking questions. Especially from self-important dogmatists who believed they had all the answers. And he would follow one question with another question. Many of his interlocutors were annoyed by his behaviour. And dubbed him a "gadfly". Many believed that they wanted to undermine his power.

In reality, Socrates had only one aim. He wanted to expand knowledge. But not just his, but the collective knowledge of all humanity.

## Anti-Patterns

### "Venerable Experts"

Sadly, much of Sri Lankan discourse has a very anti-Socratic nature. We love authority and the opinions of authorities.

Recently, I attended a Bhana (Buddhist lecture). Where the lecturing monk was not only irrelevant but also inaccurate. I am sure many in attendance recognised these errors, but no one questioned anything. This is so ingrained in our culture that "saying no" to a Buddhist monk is considered taboo.

This basis extends to education in general. In primary and secondary school, the teacher is always right. In university, the lecturer or professor is. And in real life, we tend to believe anything experts tell us. Because they are "experts" or "professors" or "reverends" or "doctors".

### "Paper Qualifications"

A common question in professional recruiting is:

>>> "Is this person suitable for the job?"

The easy way out is to look at their paper qualifications. "He has a Masters Degree. He must be good. We don't have to interview him!"

A more challenging course is to ask a question. Or to be exact, many questions. In the form of an interview. Sadly, many employers are unable to conduct an interview. That might see through dubious paper qualifications. Because they don't know how to judge a good employee. So they default to the easy answer. "Do they have a degree? Yes! End of story"

## Concluding Questions

Should you use the Socratic method?

Is the aphorism "Dumb people have all the answers. Smart people have all the questions" true?

I'll leave that as an exercise for you, dear reader. You could try answering it.

Or better still ask a question.
