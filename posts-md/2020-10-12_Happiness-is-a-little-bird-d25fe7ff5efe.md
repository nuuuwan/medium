# Happiness is a little bird

I gaze into the eyes of a little birdThat I hold gently in the palms of my hands.It is flightless, helpless...I smile at it, and I see my face smiling back through its tiny eyes.I am happy. And I am happier that its little face mirrors my happiness.

Afternoon, after afternoon we spendSupposedly in each other's companyEach hour passes with each smile...Each smile with each hour...The smiles are all mine. Little bird is beginning to flap its wings...I am happy. And am happier still for what I imagine are its little smiles...

Slowly it is evening. Dusk is golden brownDark creatures are returning home to nest.Oddly the cool winds of nostalgia feel strangely warm.I imagine that I am happy. Happier still, that I have let my little bird free.It has flown away.

Now it is night. The stars don't shine. For it is a night of clouds. A cloud of nights. Dreamless dreams full of masquerading imaginings. Imaginings of happiness. Happiness folded tightly in imagination. Now I am alone. Longing for warmth. Longing for a disconnection from reality.Longing to hold that little flightless bird in my hands again. Alas. Little bird has flown away.
