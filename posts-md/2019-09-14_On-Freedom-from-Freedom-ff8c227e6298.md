# Free from Freedom

### Freedom, Unfreedom and Beyond

The OED defined freedom as:

>>> "The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants."

What one wants means differs from person to person and situation to situation and might be contradictory. For example, if you were an ISIS terrorist, what you want might be the freedom to set fire to Jordanian airforce pilots. But if one were a Jordanian airforce pilot, then what you what might be the freedom not be set upon the fire. Hence, freedom is always relative to the subject (e.g. ISIS terrorist, or Jordanian airforce pilot).

Just as individuals have individual notions of freedom, collections of individuals (e.g. countries) share (or claim to share) collective ideas of freedom. Sometimes these notions are codified into law. For example, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution codifies the concepts of freedom relating to religion, speech, press, assembly and petitioning:

>>> "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

## From Freedom to Unfreedom

Suppose you believe in the freedom to practice a religion of your choice. How would you apply this freedom to a religion X that requires that people should not have the freedom to follow other religions? And that the followers of X should have the freedom to persecute adherents of other religions?

There is a paradox here. On the one hand, if you don't allow people to follow X, you betray your belief in freedom of religion. On the other hand, if you allow people to follow X, then you implicitly support the suppression of religions and thus again betray your belief.

How might we get around this paradox?

We could add a "Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated" (a form of Golden Rule) clause to all religions, and those religions (like X) that don't conform, are not afforded the protection of the law.

This solution is a form of regulation: we subject all religions to a rule "Do not suppress other religions" so that freedom of religion can be maintained. But regulation in particular, and rules, in general, are a form of unfreedom. They take away the power and right to act, speak and think.

Hence,

>>> No set of freedoms is viable, without a corresponding set of unfreedoms.

## Beyond Freedom and Unfreedom

Is unfreedom the opposite of freedom?

Consider our ISIS terrorist and the Jordanian pilot. The former's freedom was the latter's unfreedom. And the former's unfreedom was the latter's freedom. Hence, in many ways, the difference between freedom and unfreedom is subjective and individual. Was the Jordanian airforce pilot being set on fire any different from a set of ISIS terrorists burning alive after an airstrike with the complements of the Jordanian airforce? Would the pain felt by one human burning at very high temperature, be significantly different from that felt by another facing a similar predicament?

Hence, the opposite of freedom cannot be unfreedom because freedom is unfreedom. And unfreedom is freedom.

But then what is the opposite of freedom and unfreedom?

Let's consider the definition of freedom more closely. What one wants is a hope for the future. The ISIS terrorist hopes for a future where the Jordanian pilot is burnt alive. The pilot, on the other hand, hopes for a future where he is alive and unburnt.

Hence, the opposite of freedom is not having hopes for the future. Note, this is not despair, which is the belief (or even hope) that the future will be bad and negative. Nor having hopes for the future is purely a matter of accepting that the future is uncertain, unpredictable, and unknowable, and there is no point in having specific hopes for the future.

Hence,

>>> True freedom is being free of the need for freedoms.

## Concluding question?

Zooming back from abstract philosophising to the concrete real world, where does this get us? Are their any needs for freedom we can give up?

>>> What freedoms might we give up so that our lives might be lighter and happier?

I'll leave these questions as an exercise to the reader.
