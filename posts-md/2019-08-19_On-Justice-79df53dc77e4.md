What is justice?

The OED defines "just" as "Based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair". Its essence is "right". We all have some notion of "what is right", and justice is about "right being done".

From where does our "sense of justice" or "sense of right" come?

Some believe that the universe is innately just, possibly facilitated by a "just God". And that our sense of justice and right comes from this divine fount. However, even many who don't hold this theological view, do have a strong sense of "justice" or "right".

So, from where does this come?

The existence of "right" implies that there is also "wrong". A belief in either implies a belief that there is a "right way for things to happen" and a "wrong way for things to happen", and that the "right way" is the "right" way.

Splitting the "way things happen" into "right" and "wrong" implies an opinion (on what is right and wrong), which conditions our view of the world.

Hence, a "yearning" or "clinging" for justice, implies a yearning for this opinion to be true, again and again. Or in other words, to make this opinion permanent.

But, what if you also believe that nothing is permanent or constant?

Then, is there any point in believing in , or yearning for justice?

When we feel "wronged" by an injustice, what is actually "wrong"? The "wrongness" of the wrong? Or our "belief" in the wrongness of the wrong? For, if we didn't believe it wrong, it wouldn't be wrong and an injustice, would it?

Conversely, if we don't believe in "wrong", then can we ever suffer injustice?
