## On the Survival of Nations

* The world is an ecosystem. Nations are organisms. Their politics are their DNA.

* Nations that are fit to survive, survive. The nations that are nations today, are those that survived.

## On Conservatism

* Conservatives believe in the fitness of the current DNA. There is some justification to this belief. The current DNA has enabled survival. Thus far, at least.

## On Radicalism

* Radicals believe that the current DNA is diseased, and that a mutation is necessary to ensure future survival.

* Most mutations kill the organism. Some even kill the species.

* Some mutations, do, however, result in a better, fitter species. Likewise, sometimes a nation's survival depends on Radicals. Sometimes.

## On Ideas

* Conservatism and Radicalism have nothing to do with specific ideas, and are only relative to the status quo at a given time — the current DNA. For example, a liberal in a fascist nation is just as radical as a fascist in a liberal nation.

* Conservatives believe that conservatism is good, and each radical idea opposing it, evil. Radicals believe the current conservatisms to be evil. This sense of good and evil are relative and transient.

* Ideas change over time. Slavery was a conservative idea for most of history. Today, it would be radical.

## On Actions

* Conservative action (or more often inaction) results is slow or no change. Radical action results in unpredictable change.

* The problem with conservative action is that it won't change things much. The problem with radical action is that it will change things too much.

* "Interventions" (like invading a country) is usually conservative from the intervener's point-of-view, and radical from the intervenee's point-of-view.

## On Appearances

* Conservatives (sometimes) look like conservatives. Radicals rarely look like radicals. A western journalist in a comfortable office arguing for the invasion of another country is a radical. A poorly armed soldier, fighting for his life and that country is a conservative.

* Conservatives want to remain and appear conservative. Radicals want to become the conservatives of the future, and (one way or the other), their wishes are satisfied.

* Successful Radicals define the Conservatism of the future. Failed Radicals convert to the Conservatism of the present, or die trying not to.

## On Policy

* One could be a radical and conservative at the same time. US middle-east policy is conservative domestically (in the US), and radical for Iraq, or Afganistan.

* The same party could have both radical and conservative policies. Universal healthcare is a radical policy in the US, while high global defence spending is conservative. Democrats support both.

* The same policy can be both radical and conservative in different nations. Privatised health-care is radical in Norther Europe, but conservative in the US.

## On Effectiveness

* Political ideas that are effective survive. Political ideas that are good, are political ideas that are good.

* It is easy not to be wrong with conservative policies. And easy not to be right with radical ones.

* The most successful nations have been mostly conservative, with a few injections of radicalism from time to time.

* Nations that have never been radical, have never enjoyed extraordinarily success. Nor have they suffered from extraordinarily failure.

* Nations that have never been conservative don't exist.
