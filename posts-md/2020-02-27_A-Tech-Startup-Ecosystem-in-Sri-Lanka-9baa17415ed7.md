# A Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka

### Part II: Can we build a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka?

In Part I (What makes a good tech startup ecosystem?), I defined the "Startup Paradox" as follows:

>>> Ideal startup ecosystems are "nice places". Complete with funding, market reach, connections, talent, experience and knowledge. But invariably, the best startup entrepreneurs tend to come from "not-so-nice places". Often places with economic hardship, war and persecution.

>>> Thus, often a startup-hub is not just one place. But two places: the nice place and the not-so-nice-place. The former is the "official startup hub". While the latter is where many of the entrepreneurs come from.

The answer to "Can we build a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka?" depends on two questions:

* Can Sri Lanka be a "Nice (enough) Place" to support a Startup Hub?

* Does Sri Lanka have sources of "Not-so-nice Places" that can supply entrepreneurs?

## Question 1: Can Sri Lanka be a "Nice (enough) Place" to support a Startup Hub?

>>> The ideal tech startup ecosystem is a "support system". It has everything a startup needs. Funding is available at a reasonable cost. And it has connections to markets and economies.

>>> Thus, the ideal tech startup ecosystem becomes a magnet for talent. Not only new entrepreneurs looking for their first wins. But also experienced veterans. Seasoned entrepreneurs who have succeeded elsewhere, often many times. "Knowledge organisations" like universities and research groups, join these people. (Part I)

Does Sri Lanka have adequate funding? Do we have access to markets and economies? Do we have decent "knowledge organisations"?

The most common answer I've heard is:

>>> Yes, but not enough. We could do better.

For example, there is a nascent angel investor community in Sri Lanka. Which is good. But too often, startups need to give up a too larger share of their business for a too smaller amount of funding. Hence, not good enough. Similarly, Sri Lanka has access to large markets, especially in South and East Asia. Which is good. But at the same time has various problems with brand, reputation, access and exposure. Hence, again, not good enough. The same probably applies to "Knowledge Organisations" and other factors.

Hence, unsurprisingly, many people have been trying to improve these factors. From "not good enough" to "better". Presumably, these people believe that the answer to "Can Sri Lanka be a "Nice (enough) Place" to support a Startup Hub?" is yes. And they might be right.

But then what is the problem?

The problem is that most people "with the good of Sri Lankan Startups at heart", have over-focussed on "Can Sri Lanka be a "Nice (enough) Place". And completely ignored the second question: "Does Sri Lanka have sources of "Not-so-nice Places" that can supply entrepreneurs?"

## Question 2: Does Sri Lanka have sources of "Not-so-nice Places" that can supply entrepreneurs?

The Israeli Entrepreneur-turned Early Stage Investor (who inspired these articles — see Part I), visited Sri Lanka to invest in, not one startup, but a bucket of startups. The point of a bucket was to "diversify" the portfolio. Since most startups only have a small chance of success, the only wise investment is a diversified one.

The problem with the Sri Lankan Startup Ecosystem was that there weren't enough startups to fill a bucket. An investor could find one or two potentially promising startups. But not enough to build a diverse portfolio. Hence, any investor had one of two options:

* Leave Sri Lanka, and invest somewhere else. Like the Israeli did.

* Pass on the risk to the entrepreneurs, by offering little funding for a lot of shares. Like most Sri Lankan angels do.

Now you might ask, why can't Sri Lankan startups be Part of some bigger bucket. Like Indian startups. This is a fair point. And many investors do invest in Sri Lanka as Part of a larger South Asian or Asian bucket. However, many don't. Because investing in another country involves some non-trivial fixed costs. And the supply in Sri Lanka is a small fraction of giant India.

The cause of this supply problem is that Sri Lanka has no "Not-so-nice-Places". Hence, the solution lies in "building" such places.

## What to do?

In Part I, I gave several examples of "Nice" Startup Hubs, and their corresponding "Not So Nice" sources of entrepreneurs. Let's see what Sri Lanka might learn from these.

### Singapore and Incentives

>>> Singapore's "not-so-niceness" comes from its government. Which is, on paper, democratic. But in many ways autocratic. There is a significant amount of pressure applied to all manner of institutions, from universities to companies, to innovate. Particularly technology. (Part I)

What if the Sri Lankan government creates incentives for universities and companies to drive more innovation? For example, through special funding and other financial incentives?

And what if innovation is engrained into work culture? For example, what if university professors are not evaluated on publications in esoteric journals, but on the FDI their research helps bring in?

Of course, there are pros and cons to these measures. But this is what Singapore does. And it has undoubtedly yielded them some pros.

### Silicon Valley (SV) and Immigration

>>> Silicon value has all the "nice" properties of a startup hub, from almost infinite funding to broad market reach. However, a disproportionate number of successful SV startups have been founded by immigrants from "not-so-nice-places". (Part I)

The main factor that has driven SV's success is that it has been a magnet for global talent. A simple solution to Sri Lanka's entrepreneur (and general labour) shortage would be to make immigration easier. Particularly from South and East Asia.

Now, while SV has been generally positive for the world and its entrepreneurs, it has been hugely detrimental for Native Californians. Many were "priced out" and had to leave their homes for other parts of the country. Similarly, if Indians and Indonesians throng to Colombo and other parts of the country, many "Native" Sri Lankans will suffer. For all sorts of reasons.

Hence, this whole discussion has a general caveat: Do we want a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka? Because it will involve breaking some eggs.

### Beijing/Shanghai and "Internal Immigration"

A large proportion of Colombo's "Startups" founded by rich kids with rich dads. Because being a "founder" is cool. Because you can wear hip clothes. And attend "events". These Pseudo-Startups are a complete waste of time. And I've learnt to avoid these like the plague.

In contrast, a lot of meaningful tech startups have emerged from other parts of the country. Other towns like Galle, Jaffna and Kurunegala. And even suburbs of Colombo — disconnected from the Pseudo-Startup hype.

By "Internal Immigration", I don't mean entrepreneurs coming to Colombo. But investors and marketers exploring other parts of the country. Similarly, the government could consider investing in such places. As well as incentivising their schools and universities.

### Tel-Aviv and "Intimidation"

The "Island Culture" is very much a part of Sri Lanka. Food and shelter are generally (if not necessarily excellent) almost always sufficient. Relaxation and leisure usually take precedence over the stresses of hard work. Weekends and holidays are valued over "work days". Hence, in some ways "Sri Lankan Culture" and "Entrepreneurship" are a contradiction in terms.

In contrast, many Startup Hubs are driven by threats and intimidation. For example, in Part I, I described Tel-Aviv as follows:

>>> Israel's "not-so-niceness" derives, not from poverty, but from geopolitics and history. Israel's neighbours want to blow it off the face of the earth. To this end, they have waged many wars. Both military and "diplomatic". While on the surface Israel might have the "niceness" of a developed country, there is a constant "not-so-nice" threat of destruction. This has driven unparalleled development. Particularly in defence and security technology.

Does Sri Lanka have "threats" that might be a source of motivation?

Several come to mind. But Climate Change is my favourite.

"Hot and Humid" countries like Sri Lanka are particularly vulnerable from rising temperatures. 35 degrees with 100% humidity can be fatal for humans. And such numbers of increasingly more common in many parts of the Island. Rising sea and river levels, and the resulting floods are also a threat to some of the most densely populated areas. Finally, poor air quality is causing a spike in asthma and respiratory disease. Particularly in children.

What if Sri Lanka can become the leader in Climate Change Tech?

## Concluding Thoughts

Should we build a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka?

There are arguments both ways. Just as Native Californians have suffered from Silicon Valley, the construction process will involve breaking some eggs.

The answer might very well be "No".

But if we decide "Yes", then we should set about solving the problem intelligently.

So far, those who have decided yes are only focussing on "Can Sri Lanka be a "Nice (enough) Place" to support a Startup Hub?". And are ignoring "Does Sri Lanka have sources of "Not-so-nice Places" that can supply entrepreneurs?".

Without a good answer to the latter, the pursing the former is a waste of time.
