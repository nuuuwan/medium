# On Stack Ranking in Performance Evaluation

### Some brief thoughts, from my days at Facebook

What I understand by the "Stack-ranking approach" is "sorting" all employees in order of performance, and rewarding/punishing them accordingly. The most extreme example of this was practiced by Jack Welch (CEO of GE), where the top 10% performers were promoted, and the bottom 10% were fired.

Stack-Ranking has at least two serious problems

* Complexity. Performance is complex, and multi dimensional. Hence, it is difficult to sort people, because sorting implies that there is one numerical dimension which can be used for the sorting process. For example, Facebook engineers were evaluated on 4 qualitative dimensions (each with many sub-dimensions)

* Hostility. Stack-ranking creates very hostile and unhealthy relationships between co-working employees

These two problems result in very dysfunctional organizations — hence my dislike.

At Facebook, we evaluated engineers on an individual basis on their own merit. However, we did do the following exercises to make sure that the system was fair.

* Guidelines: Engineering Levels (E3, E4...E10) had detailed descriptions, explaining what is expected of an engineer at a certain level. Within each level, there were similar guidelines for ratings (Meets Some Expectations, Meets Most, Meets All , Exceeds, Greatly Exceeds, Redefines). There were also case studies and mock descriptions of engineers and their ratings.2

* Calibrations. As part of the performance evaluation process, Engineering managers met in groups and discussed similar employees. For example, two E3 (junior) engineers working in a similar area (e.g. Front End Product Development) who are both "exceeding expectations" should have comparable performance. If one looks significantly better than the other, then there might be something wrong.

* Statistics. As the company got bigger, the distributions of how many people got promoted, and the ratings people got were compared across the company, to make sure that they were roughly similar. If a part of the company looked significantly different from the rest, then there would be some investigation as to why, and in some cases engineering managers would be asked to re-calibrate their ratings and promotion decisions. This process was sometimes interpreted as "Stack-Ranking", but I see it mostly as a process to ensure fairness across the company. Note, the statistics involved comparing aggregated statistics for 100s of employees.

DISCLAIMER: I worked at Facebook from 2009 to 2017. My observations are from this period, and specific to the Engineering organisation. I don't have as deep a knowledge of practices in other organizations like Sales/Marketing etc.
