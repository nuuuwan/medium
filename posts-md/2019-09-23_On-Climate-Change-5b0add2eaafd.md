# On Climate Change

### Some bad statistics

Sri Lanka has appeared at the top of the Global Climate Risk Index in the last couple of years.

The 2019 report said,

>>> In May 2017, heavy landslides and floods occurred in Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains in southwestern regions of the country. More than 200 people died after the worst rains on the Indian Ocean island since 2003. The monsoons displaced more than 600 000 people from their homes and 12 districts were affected. The inland southwest district of Ratnapura was most affected where over 20 000 people faced flash floods.

The Global Climate Risk Index is based on the number of deaths resulting from climate-related disasters.

One problem with Climate Change is that there is a misalignment of who is able to solve the problem, and who is willing to solve the problem. To visualize this, I plotted Carbon Dioxide emissions vs the deaths from climate-related disasters.

[The linear trend-line appears curved, because the Axis have been scaled logarithmically]

The countries of the world fall into four groups:

* Problem, No Solution. Countries like Haiti, that are affected by disasters, but don't have significant emissions. These countries have a problem, but no solution.

* Problem and Solution. Countries like India, China and the US that are both affected by disasters, and have significant emissions. These countries have both a problem but are also able to influence the solution.

* Solution, No Problem. Countries like Canada that produce large amounts of emissions, but have not been affected by disasters as much. They can influence the solution, but don't have much of an incentive.

* Everyone else.

## Bad Statistics

### Y = mX + C + Error

The number of deaths from climate disasters, is weakly correlated with CO₂ emmission mass (R² = 0.2812). The linear relationship is:

>>> Deaths = 0.107 * Emissions + 23.85

The weak correlation is bad news. But on the other hand, some correlation is heartening. It is particularly good that big emitters like India, China and the US have recently felt the wrath of several Climate change related natural disasters.

### US = (Canada + Haiti) / 2

On the other hand, these are big countries, and the distribution of deaths and emissions are highly skewed. In the US, for example, poor populations around the Gulf of Mexico, have been disproportionately effected by natural disasters like hurricanes. Hence, while the US as a whole might be "Problem and Solution", it might be completely fragmented into many populations of "Solution, No Problem" and "Problem, No Solution". In other words, the US might be a collection of Canadas and Haitis.

### Deaths = 0

The Maldives had no deaths from climate disasters in 2016. And hence, doesn't even appear on the plot. On the other hand, it would almost certainly be decimated by rising sea-levels. This is a particular case of a general problem. The effects of things like emissions take several decades to cause deaths and other harmful effects. We don't have useful statistics that predict the future impact of Climate Change.

### CO₂ + what?

CO₂ emissions are not the only way countries harm the environment. Many other factors contribute. Hence, similarly, we don't have useful statistics to aggregate all the causes of Climate Change either.

## Concluding Thought

Given that we are generally bad and quantifying both causes and effects, I wonder to what extent this badness of statistics will effect our ability or inability to solve the Climate Change problem.
