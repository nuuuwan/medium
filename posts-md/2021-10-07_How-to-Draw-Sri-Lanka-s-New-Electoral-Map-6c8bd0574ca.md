# How to Draw Sri Lanka's New Electoral Map

### The Electoral Map Mapping Algorithm (EMMA)

We concluded Proportional Representation, First-Past-the-Post or Both? with the three questions including,

>>> "What would the Electoral Map look like if we returned to FPTP or adopted some mixed system?"

In 5 Properties of Good Electoral Maps, we answered a meta-question needed to answer the above, namely,

>>> "What properties make a Good Electoral Map?".

In this article, we describe an "Electoral Map Mapping Algorithm" (EMMA) that will programmatically generate a new Electoral Map for Sri Lanka that both obey the "5 Properties" and might be suitable for FPTP or mixed elections.
