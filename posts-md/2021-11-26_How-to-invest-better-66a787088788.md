# How to invest better

### By playing dice

What do all investments have in common? They all provide you with the opportunity to net some money. How much money? Various investments differ. Some have the potential to net you more money; others less.

Why do opportunities that net you less exist? After all, isn't it rational to invest in whatever opportunity that would net you the most amount of money?

Not quite — because you need to factor in uncertainty — also known as risk. With almost all investments, there is no guarantee of a certain net gain. And opportunities that have a higher average return also tend to have a higher risk.

## Two Imaginary Games

For example, consider the following two dice games: Game A and Game B.

>>> You need to pay Rs. 1000 to play either game.

>>> In-Game A, you win Rs. 12,000 if you throw six and nothing if you don't.

>>> In-Game B, you win Rs. 3000 if you throw 4, 5 or 6, and nothing if you don't.

Which game would you play? That depends.

On the one hand, Game A has an average net return of Rs. 1000 per game (+100%). Game B has an average net return of Rs. 500 per game (+50%).

On the other hand, there is a 5/6 chance that you lose your money from Game A. With Game B, this probability is only 1/2. Hence, while Game A has a higher average return, it is also riskier.

While these are imaginary games, real-world investments have similar properties and implications.

In the next section, I describe some examples. The numbers are approximate and are meant more as qualitative and directional.

## Real Games

### Game 0: Cash

Let's start with a trivial game. "Investing" in Cash is like a trivial dice game where,

>>> You pay Rs. 1000 to play, and you get Rs. 1000 back, whatever the outcome of the dice.

Your average net return is 0%. But your risk is also zero.

### Game 1: Fixed Deposits and "Safe" Fixed Income Investments (E.g. Government Bonds)

>>> You pay Rs. 1000 to play, and you get Rs. 1050 back, whatever the outcome of the dice.

Average net return is +5%. Risk: zero (almost — see next section).

### Game 2: Less "Safe" Fixed Income Investments

Strictly speaking, if you invest your money in a fixed deposit with a reputable bank or government bond, there is a small probability that you will lose your money — e.g. if the bank goes bust or the financial system of the country crashes. This "small probability" is usually much lower than 1/6 [the smallest probability we can represent in our dice game].

However, (say) with a less safe finance company, the probability of a default can be much higher (even 1/6 or more). Usually, such companies give higher interest rates on deposits.

In other words, like a game where,

>>> You pay Rs. 1000 to play, and you get Rs. 1320 back if you throw 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and lose your money if you throw 1.

Average net return if the company doesn't go bust: +32% (this is what is usually advertised). Actual average net return +10% (this is what you should consider). 1/6 chance of losing your money.

### Game 3: Stocks (Investing for one year in the Colombo Stock Exchange)

>>> You pay Rs. 1000 to play.

>>> If you throw 1, you get back Rs. 7002: Rs. 9003:Rs. 1,0004: Rs. 1,1005: Rs. 1,3006: Rs. 1,600

Average net return: +10%. Odds of losing all your money: zero. Odds of losing some money: 1/3.

These numbers are based on your earnings in 1 year, had you invested Rs. 1000 in a stock index fund that tracked the Colombo Stock Exchange's ASPI (All Share Price Index) at some random point in time between 1993 and 2021.

### Game 3a: Stocks (Investing for five years)

>>> You pay Rs. 1000 to play.

>>> If you throw 1, you get back Rs. 9002: Rs. 1,0003: Rs. 1,1004: Rs. 1,2005: Rs. 1,3006: Rs. 1,300

Average net return: +13%. Odds of losing all your money: zero. Odds of losing some money: 1/6.

Like Game 3, these numbers are based on ASPI statistics, but considering gains for a 5-year window, annualised.

Note the average return is roughly the same (i.e. the difference is not statistically significant), but the risk of losing some money is considerably smaller (statistically significant).

### Side Topic: Playing many games

Game 3a is equivalent to playing Game 3 five times. In general, if your average return is positive, you can lower your risk by playing the game several times, investing over a longer time window.

However, if you don't have time for a long window (e.g. if you are elderly), then it is best to invest in safer investments.

### Game 4: Entrepreneurship and investing in startups

>>> You pay Rs. 1000 to play.

>>> If you throw a six, you get Rs. 60,000, and nothing if not

Average net return: +999%. Chance of losing money 5/6.

As with the stock market, playing many games is the only way to make money from startups. On the downside, since the risk is much higher, you need to play many more games, compared to the stock market. On the upside, the return is also much, much higher.

### Game 5: Gambling in a Casino

[Not really "investing", but I thought the comparison interesting]

>>> You play Rs. 1000 to play.

>>> If you throw a six, you get Rs. 5,833, and nothing if not.

Average net return: -3%. Chance of losing money 5/6.

These numbers are based on the 35/36 odds that most casinos are supposed to have. For every Rs. 36 gambled, the house gets Rs. 1, and the remainder is returned to the players.

Hence, unlike proper investments, gambling has a negative average net return. Playing many games will not help. The more you play, the more you lose.

### Game 6: Insurance

While you probably don't consider "Insurance" an investment, it tends to behave like it is. Consider this toy example:

Suppose you have a car worth Rs. 5,000, and suppose the odds of crashing it are 1/6. If you don't have insurance, there is a 5/6 that you don't lose anything and a 1/6 chance of losing Rs. 5,000.

Now, suppose you get car insurance, which costs Rs. 1,000. There is a 5/6 chance that you don't crash your car, and you lose your insurance money, and a 1/6 chance that you crash your car, and the insurance company reimburses you.

The "net effect" of insurance is the difference between the two. In other words, there is a 5/6 chance of losing the Rs. 5,000 insurance fee, and 1/6 chance of netting the difference between the insured amount and the fee.

It is like a dice game where,

>>> You play Rs. 1,000 to play.

>>> If you throw six, you get Rs. 5,000, and nothing if not.

Average net return: -17%. Chance of losing money 5/6.

Note, obviously, the numbers above are unrealistic. Even the worst driver will have better than 1/6 odds, and no car has cost Rs. 5,000 since World War II (or I?). But as I said earlier, I meant the numbers to be directional and qualitative. Or in other words, to highlight the purpose of insurance: losing a little money instead of losing a lot.

In a sense, life is like gambling in a casino. And directionally, the odds are similar. However, unlike gambling in a casino, we have no choice, but to play the game. Insurance makes the odds (and life) a bit more bearable.
