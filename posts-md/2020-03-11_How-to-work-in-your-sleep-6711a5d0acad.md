# How to work in your sleep

### Some personal reflections

Disclaimer: I'm not a physician, psychologist or sleep expert. I'm writing about something that has worked for me. It might work for you. Then again, it might not. Either way, I'd appreciate your comments and feedback. The book Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams, by neuroscientist and sleep researcher, Matthew Walker, has inspired and influenced this article.

## The Machine

Our brains are powerful machines. We use it all the time. For all manner of tasks. From folding clothes to writing operas.

Sleep comes in two forms:

* NREM Sleep or "Non-Rapid Eye Movement" Sleep. Where one is "dead to the world" and where one goes to sleep and wakes up eight hours later, as if was the next moment.

* "Rapid Eye Movement" or REM sleep. Where one dreams. While both mind and body are "shut down" during NREM sleep, the mind is awake during REM sleep. That is why one dreams.

Dreams are subconscious meanderings. Where your thoughts bounce off partial and disconnected ideas. It is also where "creativity" happens. When disconnected ideas "have sex" to spawn new ideas. If you think about it, familiar people, places and concepts make-up dreams. But these people, places and concepts combine in strange and fascinating ways. Which is what makes dreams interesting.

Can we get dreams and other subconscious activities to "work for us"? We can!

## Uploading Problems to the Machine

Think of the most exciting and creative problems you need to solve. If you are a Software Engineer, it might be, "What is the most efficient way to design that architecture?". If you are a UEX designer, "What would the most simple and intuitive UI look like?". If you are a political strategist, "How might we win over demographic X?". Your problem depends on your work. You know best.

Not less than two hours before you go to sleep, find some way of reflecting on the tasks. At the end of the "workday", I write down a list of the most fascinating unsolved problems. Another could be going through them in memory. Another could be speaking them out loud: "How do I design a better messaging UI?"

Use whatever that is most natural. But you mustn't overthink. Conscious thinking is a conscious task. And conscious tasks tend to usurp mental energy for subconscious tasks. If you overthink, you might spend the rest of the day thinking about them, and this might even disrupt your sleep.

## Running the Machine

How should you run the machine? Try to maximise the amount of REM sleep.

To do this, first, try to optimise sleep in general. Make sure that your sleeping arrangements are comfortable. Cool, silent and dark. A fixed set of sleeping hours also helps.

Avoid alcohol and caffeine. While sometimes encouraging NREM sleep, they tend to disturb REM sleep. Some foods, like milk, tend to promote REM sleep. A cup of hot milk before bed is ideal.

## Downloading Solutions from the Machine

You can't copy the solutions to a pen-drive, as you could from a conventional computer. Or photocopy them, as you would do from a book. You need to give the machine "some space and time". To download the solutions from your subconscious to your conscious memory.

I try to minimise "conscious thinking" during the first two hours after I wake. I meditate for about 45 minutes. Meditation consists of "observing without thinking" or "being without doing". And helps, with the downloading process. I try to do some "mundane" tasks that don't need conscious brainpower. Like arranging dishes drying in the kitchen overnight. Or tidying-up the house. Or going for a walk. Jeff Bezos calls this "pottering around".

## Does it work?

Be patient. Unlike the conscious mind that can "obey orders", the subconscious mind takes its own time. The machine might solve the problems you upload today, in a week or month.

The subconscious mind also tends to do things its own way. You might upload one problem, but the solution is for a different problem. It might be a solution to a "better" problem.

It works for me. That's the only "evidence" I have.

Try it out and see if it works for you.
