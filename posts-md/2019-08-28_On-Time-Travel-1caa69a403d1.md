# On Time Travel

### More adventures with coins

## Time

The relationship between time and information is interesting. As time "increases" so does information. In other words, there is more information in the present, than there was in the past.

For example, suppose we toss a coin. After the coin lands heads or tails, there is one additional bit of information (namely whether the coin landed heads or tails) in the universe. Before the coin toss, this information didn't exist.

To be clear, a coin toss results in a lot more information than a single bit. For example, if the coin landed on the ground, there is its precise location. There is the collective memory of the people who saw the coin toss. There might be some additional record of the coin toss; someone might have written down the outcome, or recorded it on video. In practice, the coin toss probably resulted in exa-bytes of data.

But let's ignore these details for now. My point is: information increases with time, or alternatively, time increases with information.

## Stopping Time

Now suppose that the coin was indeed tossed, but there was no record of it. Suppose, no one remembered the outcome of the toss, nor was it recorded on video, and nor did anyone write down the outcome.

Now, if there is no record of the outcome of the coin toss, can we say that information has been added to the universe?

And if information was not added to the universe, did time pass? Given that the present has the same information as the past?

## Reversing Time

Now suppose that the coin was tossed, and its outcome (say, heads) was recorded on multiple media: paper, video, and the collective memories of several bystanders.

However, suppose that soon after that the following happened: the paper with the outcome was burned; the video was dismiised as a fake, probably doctored by the Russians, Hillary Clinton, or Wile E. Coyote; and all the bystanders got amnesia, probably as a result of attending a 5 Seconds of Summer concert.

Now, the past (soon after the coin toss) clearly contained that bit of information about the outcome of the coin-toss. But the present (post paper burning, Russian fakes, and 5 Seconds of Summer), does not contain the said bit. Hence, the present has less information than the past. Hence, did we travel back in time?

## Concluding Perspective

We say that after tossing the coin there was more information in the universe. But is this actually true?

I don't know how much information exists in all that is the universe: probably exa-exa-exa-bytes, give or take. Was it that the coin-toss increased this information, or that we decided to arbitrarily label some set of information as new information?

Was it that we decided that some set of information represents "no outcome", and a different set (with the same amount of information) represents "some outcome"?

And would this apply to all information? Everything that we know? Mere labels of things we choose to know and choose not to know?
