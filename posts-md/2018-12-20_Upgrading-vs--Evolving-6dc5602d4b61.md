### Prelude: Definitions

* Evolving: Optimizing an entity, by making many copies of the entity each with small changes, then destroying those entities that are less optimal, and continuing the process with the entities that are more optimal.

* Upgrading: Optimizing an entity, by making a specific set of well defined changes to it, known to make it more optimal.

### Fugue: Aphorisms

* Means and Ends. To Upgrade, both ends and means must be known. To Evolve, only ends needs to be known. In practice, often neither ends nor means are known.

* Knowledge. Understanding the means of solving a problem, is much harder than understanding the nature of a solved problem (which is usually the same as understanding the problem). Hence, knowing how to upgrade is almost always harder than knowing how to evolve.

* Justification. An upgrade can be justified, by explaining how the improvement improves fitness. The only justification of evolution is that "it works". The justification of an upgrade is easy to communicate, but rarely valid. The justification of an evolution is often valid, but difficult to communicate.

* Hindsight. The result of evolution over many generations can be described as an upgrade of a single step. However, such descriptions are usually incomplete, and the correlation often lacks causation.

* Generations. Upgrading involves improving the fitness of an entity within a single generation. Evolving involves destroying the entities of one generation, so that the next generation might be slightly fitter.

* Cruelty: When the entities and generations involved are human, evolution is cruel, despite being effective. Hence, often Upgrades are chosen as a less cruel (but also sadly, less effective) alternative. For example, many strong nations have emerged out of centuries of hardship. However, hardship is never prescribed as a path for economic development. Instead, economist design various "Upgrade playbooks".

* Scale. Evolution favours small scale, while Upgrading favours large scale.
