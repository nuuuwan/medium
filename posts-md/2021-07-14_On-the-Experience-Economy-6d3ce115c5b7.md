# On the Experience Economy

What comes to mind when you hear the words "Experience Economy"?

You might imagine the latest social-media oligarch proselytizing his latest idea to get teenagers to look at cats or babies doing amazing things.

But "Experience Economy" extends far beyond instant gratification and influences. Economics is fundamentally the Economics of Experience, and there is no economy outside the experience economy.

"But wait!" you might say. "I'm an ascetic. I don't care about experiences. I only eat to sustain my body. I gain neither pleasure nor pain from it."

At some level, eating is about objective, real-world things; about sustaining the atoms and molecules of our bodies; about gaining our daily allowance of 2000 calories (or whatever it is).

But no one really eats for objective reasons. We all eat because we want to experience feeling full (or not experience feeling empty), because we want to experience the feeling of strength and health (or not experience weakness or sickness), because we want a "good" experience (and not "bad").

Wikipedia says, "Economics is the social science that studies how people interact with value". They should say, "Economics is the social science that studies how people interact with experiences".
