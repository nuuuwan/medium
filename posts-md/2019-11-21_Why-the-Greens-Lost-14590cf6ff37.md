# Why the Greens Lost

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

## Base and Float

A "base voter" of a political party is a voter who votes for that party no matter what. A guaranteed vote for the party. In On Floating Voters, I estimated that the SLPP had a "base" of about 44% of the total vote, and the NDF about 39%.

The remaining "floating voters" could vote for either party. This latter block usually ends-up deciding the outcome of the election.

Using the data from the 2019 election (together with previous elections), I re-estimated these numbers. The SLPP had a "base" of about 43.6%, and the NDF a somewhat reduced base of 37.0%. This left a floating vote of about 19.4%.

The floating vote distributed across the island as follows:

With a 37.0% base, the NDF needed a further 13% to win the election. The SLPP, on the other hand, with a substantial 43.6% base, needed only 6.4%. Hence, the NDF had a much harder task before them.

## Performance in Elections

In 2015, the Greens managed to secure a significant majority of the floating vote across the country.

Conversely, in 2005, they failed, particularly in the Western Province. Many people (reasonably) cite the "LTTE-Boycott" as a reason for the Green defeat. But if they had done a better job with the floating vote, they might have still won. Note all the "white spots" in the Western Province.

The Green's performance was even worse in 2019.

Let's break this down.

The NDF dominated the floating vote in the Nothern and Eastern province. But more significantly, the SLPP won a majority of the floating vote in the Central, Western, and other Provinces.

Even though the SLPP won smaller percentages of floating votes, their absolute numbers were much larger.

The NDF needed more than 13% of votes from floating voters. But they managed 5.4%. On the other hand, the SLPP needed only more than 6%. And they comfortably exceeded this goal.

## What next?

The Green base vote continues to wane. It has dropped from 39% in 2015 to 37% in 2019. Hence, the Greens need to rely more and more on floating votes.

Consider the 2019 election. Suppose the Greens won 80% of the floating vote in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. And 70% in Central and Western (far better than they did). They would still have needed 60% of the floating vote from the rest of the country.

The Northern and Eastern targets seem difficult, but doable. But the Central, Western and "Rest of the Country" targets seem challenging. At best.

The Greens don't seem to have any message that appeals to the majority of the floating vote. Even if they do, that message is not resonating. While that might not be the exact cause of "Why the Greens Lost", it is clearly an effect.

You might argue (reasonably) that there were many other reasons. From disproportionate media attention to #FakeNews to "ever-green" @RW_UNP. But the bottom line is this: they only won 5.4% from the floating vote. When they needed 13%.

There is no overnight solution. Turning things around will take years, if not decades. But if I were a Green, I would ask the following questions (in increasing order of difficulty):

* How can we win more of the "Central Province" floating vote?

* How can we win more of the "Western Province" floating vote?

* How can we win more of the "Rest of the Country" floating vote?

* How can we increase our (currently waning) base?

Without good answers, there is little hope for what was Sri Lanka's premier political party.
