## 55 out of 68

With Rafael Nadal's win in the final grand slam for 2019, Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic (the "Big Three") have, between them, won an astonishing 55 out of the 68 finals (81%) since 2003.

I wanted to visualise this history in a picture:

While each of the Big Three have won at least one of the grand slams, they have clearly won some more than others. Nadal is the most "asymmetric"; 12/19 or 63% grand slams have been the French Open. Federer clearly favours grass (8/20 or 40%), and Djokovic has dominated the Australian open (7/16 or 44%).

Federer has the most "symmetric" record, which backs up the Jimmy Connors quote:

>>> "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist...or you're Roger Federer".

## Almost winning

One important factor that the previous visual ignores is that each of the Big Three often competed with each other in a grand slam final. So, although Federer and Djokovic have only won one French Open each, they have each been in 4 and 3 finals respectively, which they lost to Nadal on 6 occasions between them.

In an era without Nadal, Federer and Djokovic would have won many more French Opens, and in an era without the Big Three, so would the likes of Thiem, Andy Murray (formerly part of the "Big Four"), and Warwinka.

Counting both all grand slam final appearances (wins and losses), the visual looks like:

From this view, Nadal and Federer look more like Clay (French Open) and Grass (Wimbledon) specialists respectively, and Djokovic looks like the generalist. So should the quote be,

>>> "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist...or you're Novac Djokovic" ?

## Honourable Mentions

At one time, Andy Murray was coupled with the "Big Three" to form a "Big Four". However, this name has been dropped since then, given the gap between his performance, and the other three.

However, if were were to coin a Big Four, Murray would be a top contender, together with Stan Warwinka, both of whom have won 3 grand slams (2003–2019) each.

And if we further rewind history, we see that 5 other players (Sampras, Emerson, Laver, Borg, and Tilden) have won at least 10 grand slams.

## The Big One

There is no Big Three in women's tennis. Not even a Big Two. But there is an obvious Big One. If we look at the same period (2003–2019), Serena Williams has won 19 of 68 grand slams (not counting the four she won before 2003).

No other player comes close, with Justine Henin and Maria Sharapova a distant second and third with 7 and 5 grand slams respectively.

Williams' wins are also more symmetric than the men's. So the quote should be,

>>> "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist...or you're Serena Williams"

Game, Set and Match!
