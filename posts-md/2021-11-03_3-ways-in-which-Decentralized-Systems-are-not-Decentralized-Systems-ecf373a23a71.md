# 3 ways in which Decentralized Systems are not Decentralized Systems

### How labels deceive

Decentralization is touted as a key advantage of most decentralized systems.

For example, a crypto-currency built upon a blockchain-based distributed ledger is "decentralized". In contrast, the national monetary system controlled by a central bank is "centralized". The decentralization in the former might be considered an advantage over the latter because members are protected from arbitrary monetary policy (e.g. controlling money supply) by a central authority (e.g. a central bank).

One problem with arguments like this is that the term "decentralization" is vague. What does decentralization mean? Is "decentralization" a binary yes/no, a more nuanced property? How Decentralized are Decentralized systems?
