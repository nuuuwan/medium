# Two Types of Launches

### Strategic and Tactical

The best organisations try to design, build and launch products in a scientific way. An essential aspect of this scientific method is scientific experimentation. When a product is launched, its impact must be measured. And this impact must be meaningful and significant.

But not all product launches are equal. And in this article, I want to discuss two very different types of product launches.

## Tactical Product Launches

Suppose you run an e-commerce web service (like Amazon). And suppose you want to change the colour of the check-out button. From a dull grey, say, to an exciting orange.

You could make the change and push it to every user. But then, you won't be able to measure the impact of the change.

Hence, you run an A/B test. From your many users, you pick two small, similar and equal-sized groups. You launch the new orange button to one group (let's call this group "B"), and the other group ("A") sees the old grey button. After a couple of days, you look at various metrics for the two groups, including the number button clicks. If "A" results in "X" check-outs per day, and "B" results in "Y", and "Y" is (statistically) significantly bigger than "X". And you could conclude that the orange button is better than the old grey one.

There are other things you should also be aware of. For example, you should look at different metrics (like revenue and accidental clicks). But my point is this: You can test the impact of your launch with an A/B test. Using statistical means.

## Strategic Launches

The word strategy originates from the Greek word stratēgia (στρατηγία), which means "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship". It refers to "a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty".

The key word is "uncertainty". If a strategy does not involve significant uncertainty, then it is not strategy. It is a tactic. The word "significant" is also vital. For me, "significant uncertainty" means that the strategy cannot be validated before it is enacted using scientific or strategic means.

Consider your e-commerce web service, where you changed the check-out button from dull grey to exciting orange. Now, suppose you want to make a much more significant change. You want to completely re-wamp the check-out flow. You change the order of steps. You add new payment methods. You change the underlying back end. And you use a new client-side framework with new widgets.

The change will be expensive, but you expect it to be significantly better for customers. Initially, there will be bugs, and customers have some learning curve before they get used to the product. But in the end, it will be positive. Or so you believe.

While this type of "big change" happens all the time, it is much harder to test. In theory, we can use the same experiment process we used for the orange button launch. We could run an A/B test.

In practice, this is problematic. For this type of change, the effect might not be visible for months. Hence, we will need to run the test for several months. This would also mean that while some users get to see the new product, others are left with the old one.

Hence, very often, these big launches are just launched. Without experiment. You make a "strategic decision" to launch the big launch.

## Tactical vs Strategic Launches

Both tactical and strategic product launches have pros and cons.

On the one hand, tactical product launches are safe and scientific. If the test tells you they are good, they probably are good. A tactical approach is incremental and evolutionary.

On the other hand, tactical product launches don't lead to leaps of innovation or revolutions in technology. Hence, while strategic product launches might be criticised as rash and unscientific, an organisation needs them from time to time. As purely tactical execution might lead to local optima. Escaping these might need a revolution, as opposed to evolution.

### Identification

The important point is to recognise each for what it is. It is foolish to launch a tactical change without experiment and validation as if it were a strategic change. It is also a waste of time spending time and resources, trying to show that a strategic change is statistically significant.

### Balance

It is also essential to strike the right balance between tactical and strategic launches. An organisation with no strategic launches will not innovate and die a slow death. One without tactical launches will run out of time and resources and die a quick death.

The ideal balance is many tactical launches, punctuated by a small number of strategic launches from time to time.

At Facebook, we had an unwritten rule that teams should work on the following types of projects: 70% of time and resources on safe projects (tactical), 20% somewhat unsafe (more strategic), and 10% on crazy ideas (very strategic).

Part of the rule was the expected chance of success: the 70% projects were expected to have a 70% chance of success. The 20% a 20% chance of success. And 10% a 10% chance.

### Execution

The tactical approach is safer. And often a strategic launch can be decomposed into a series of tactical launches. If this is possible, then this is the smarter approach. On the other hand, sometimes this decomposition is not possible. Sometimes, all the components of the strategic launch must be launched simultaneously.

### Incentives

Tactical launches have small impacts and small risks. Strategic launches have (potential) large impacts, but large risks. The organisation and its employees should understand these risks and impacts well. Ideally, employees should have corresponding incentives.

Junior employees are usually responsible for tactical launches. Large strategic launches are almost always the decisions of senior employees, often the CEO of the organisation.

The two types of launches need very different compensation. The success or failure of tactical launches is visible in the short term. And hence, employees can be compensated accordingly (e.g. through bonuses).

The benefits (and costs) of strategic launches are only visible in the longer term. One problem with present-day executive compensation is that this long term is not taken into account. For example, during the financial crises, bank executives made many rash strategic decisions, which might have had short term benefits, but had substantial long term costs. However, they received huge bonuses well before the effects of their rash decisions were obvious.

Hence, incentives and compensations should be aligned with time-frame. Tactical Launches should have short-term compensation, while Strategic launches should have long-term compensation structures.
