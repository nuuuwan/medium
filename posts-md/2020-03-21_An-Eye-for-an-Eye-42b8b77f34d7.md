# An Eye for an Eye

### Makes the whole world blind

All crimes are forms of theft. A villain steals some "thing" from the victim.

When the thing is the truth, we call it fraud. When the thing is an object, we call it theft. When the thing is an eye, we call it grievous bodily harm. When the thing is life, we call it murder.

Justice is also theft. Where the victim, or society, or "the law" takes another "thing" back from the villain. In return for the crime.

When the thing is time, we call it imprisonment. When the thing is life, we call it capital punishment. When the thing is dignity, we call it "a warning".

...

Sometimes crime is justice. Especially in the eyes of the villain. Like Robinhood, who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. Because the rich had already stollen from the poor.

Sometimes justice is injustice, especially when the punishment is excessive or arbitrary.

Hence, crime and justice are the same things disguised as different things. They are both forms of theft and encourage further robbery. Both end-up propagating webs of theft and counter theft.

Some people might like to steal from others. But no one likes to be stolen from. Hence, both justice and crime ends-up making someone unhappy; regardless of who they end-up pleasing.

Hurting people cannot be right. Hence, justice is wrong; as crime is wrong.

...

The solution to crime is not to commit other crimes in return. But to find and destroy the sources of that crime. Often injustices like poverty, ignorance or illness. Often "justices" disguised as injustices: "It is just that the poor are poor", "It is just stupid are ignorant", "It is just that the weak are ill". Kill the source, and crime will die.

But many people believe in injustice as justice. "Evil" is one word that represents all injustice: "The criminal is not just poor, ignorant and ill, it is also Evil".

...

But perhaps we don't want solutions to crime. We want to commit crimes ourselves. And what better way to indulge our lust for stealing by seeing a man hang, and his families future evaporate? Not only is it legal, but it is also "just".
