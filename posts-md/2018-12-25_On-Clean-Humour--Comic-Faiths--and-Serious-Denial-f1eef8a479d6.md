### Questions based of a Venn Diagram

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*60pTLBGvJaJ7myzd3s58Tw.png)

* GREEN = Set of ideas which you accept as true

* RED = Set of ideas which you are open to make fun of, or ridicule. By "not open to" means that you would want any person making fun of or ridiculing these ideas punished.

* BLUE = Set of ideas which you can justify in a manner that most people will find acceptable.

I have also given various parts of the Venn Diagram labels. Please consider these labels as "nothing but labels", and answer your questions based on the definitions of the sets.

### Questions

* For each of the labels (Comic Truth, Serious Denial etc), what are some example that intuitively (but not analytically) come to mind?

* Can you justify your "Serious Truth" candidate? Why are you not open to exposing this idea to fun or ridicule? I.e. why are you not open to classifying this ideas as a "Comic Truth", and why do you want to punish people making the jokes?

* What are some ideas which might be serious truths to some people, and serious facts to other people?

* What do you think is the best idea in the universe? Where on the Venn Diagram would this idea go?

* If you could move all the ideas in one group into another group, what would these groups be?

* Do you feel that this Venn diagram misrepresents idea? If so, why?

* What effect does society have on your choice of group?

* If you could do so anonymously, would your classification of ideas to groups be different?
