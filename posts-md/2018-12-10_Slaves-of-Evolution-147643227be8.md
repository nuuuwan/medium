### On Cognitive Biases and Meaning

### The Origins of Slavery

In "The Art of Thinking Clearly" [1], Rolf Dobelli lists over 100 cognitive biases — or patterns where humans consistently behave irrationally. These biases exist for a good reason: they help us survive. In fact, we are here on earth today, not despite these biases, but because we have these biases. If not for them, we might not have survived. For example, many biases involve over-estimating risk; in other words we are irrationally risk averse. This is because being risk averse in a hostile, wild environment (like the African savanna, whence we spread across the planet) is a good thing. It's better to mistake a stick for a snake, than a snake for a stick [2].

Homo sapiens have roamed the earth for over 200,000 years, and for much of that time we have struggled for survival. It is only relatively recently (<10,000 years) that humans have started to dominate the planet. With this domination, humans have increasingly begun to introspect "rationally". We have tried to use logic and reason to understand the world. We have even begun to think of ourselves as "rational". In contrast, our mental machinery (our brain) hasn't evolved much in these many years. We still have a brain optimized for evolutionary survival, as opposed to cold rationality. Hence, the many biases Dobelli describes so well.

Many of the motivations and forces that govern our lives have evolutionary roots. For example, regardless how "modern", rational, and sophisticated we are, we still find food and sex immensely pleasurable. While we might be dining in a Michelin star restaurant, or moving to Vātsyāyana's Kamasutra, we are still, in essence, slaves of evolution. To survive we need to eat, hence we eat. To survive we need to breed, hence we breed. This is not to say that there is anything crude about beings that eat, sleep and have sex. We have generously embellished these acts with culture, history, spirituality, and even the divine. But there is no getting away from our humble origins.

### Slavery in the modern world

To what extent have we escaped from these origins? Not much, really. Today's archetypal "successful person" has the following two characteristics:

* Has a good job (or alternative sources of wealth) ensuring that he and his are well fed, well sheltered, and "well healthy".

* Has a family, ensuring that his genes are transmitted to the next generation.

In the times of absolute kings and emperors, the alpha males "family" consisted of harems of thousands of wives and concubines, more children, and millions of descendants. One study claims that 1 in 200 humans alive today are descendants of Genghis Khan [3]. Today, driven by better health, and a more equitable distribution of wealth, families tend to be much smaller, and uniform. On the other hand, the need for status, particularly a "good job" is stronger than it has ever been. Today's most "successful" people are powerful politicians and businessmen. And like their historical forefathers, they continue the tradition of making sure that they and theirs are well fed, well sheltered, and "well healthy".

It is not my intent to poke fun at institutions like the family, and aspirations like wanting a good career. These have ensured our survival. Instead my intent is to revisit the underlying motivations and goals — which are firmly grounded in evolutionary biology. If we are to take this path, we need to depend on some very primitive instincts and processes for all our motivation and meaning. In this sense, we are no different from animals.

But unlike animals, we have evolved minds, and this mind rebelling against its primitive roots. It is questioning its origins, and searching for new meaning. It has often "reasoned" in directions which are harmful (e.g. fundamentalist and violent sects and religions). It is constantly a source of stress and mental illness.

We are in a stalemate: We are increasingly trying to use a rational mind, to rationalize an innately irrational body. The animal and the human in us are at war. Something has to give.

There seems to be three paths forward.

* Go back to the animal in us. Accept that we are animals. Accept the innate primitiveness of our motivations and aspirations.

* Escape from the animal in us.

* Look for some middle ground. Accept that we are animals, but make use of this tool called a conscious mind.

Which path you take depends on what you want. Though, at the same time, what you want depends on what path you take. I find this "feedback loop" extremely unsatisfactory (Hence, the motivation for this article).

### End of Slavery (A Meta Solution)

To me, "End of Slavery" consists of finding a way out of this feedback loop. I don't have a good sense of what a "solution" to this problem might be, but I have a sense of the "characteristics of a solution" — or a "meta solution".

* We need to find something to "want" or "aspire to" (the "goal" of our solution)— which does not involve animal needs (like food and sex), nor the mind (which is essentially a product of these needs).

* Achieving the goal cannot make use of the "rational" mind, because it is flawed machinery, and not really rational.

* We can't trust other humans to tell us what the solution is, because speech and other forms of communication, and our brains that "understand" these forms of communication are flawed machinery. Hence, it has to be a solution that is self realized.

* We need to have some way of measuring the value of the solution. This measurement (like understanding), should also be "self-measurement".

* While we can communicate to other people about our solutions, we cannot be overly sure about the quality of our communication to these other people — again, given the primitive nature of our communication equipment.

* We cannot trust anything that promises results "in the future", because our notion of time, might be flawed by our animal brains. Hence, the solution must yield results in the present.
