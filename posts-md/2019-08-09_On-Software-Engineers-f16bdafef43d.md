# On Software Engineers

### And recruiting them

>>> "How do we hire really good Software Engineers?"

A common question I get these days.

In this article, I've attempted to answer this question, mostly based on my experience recruiting Software Engineers (SWEs) and Engineering Managers at Facebook (2009–2017). While I focus on the SWE role, many of the ideas presented can be applied to other roles.

## C-grade Candidates

Every profession has some core professional skills. For example, a Software Engineer should be able to write code; a Data Scientists should be able to analyse data; a Designer should be able to design Web Sites. The most basic employment candidate is one who has these basic skills for the role. This is what I mean by a C-grade Candidate.

As I mentioned, a SWE should be able to code. The way you test a potential SWE candidate for C-level abilities, is through a "coding interview". At Facebook, these were known as "Ninja" interviews, consisting of Data Structures and Algorithms questions.

>>> What types of questions? Should we test particular programming languages? What about frameworks?

Whenever a candidate describes themselves as "an expert in Java" or "an expert in Angular JS", I hear alarm bells ringing. This is because in a world where technology is changing so fast, being rigidly married to a single technology is a sign of inability to adapt, and learn.

Hence, coding interviews should focus on fundamentals and creativity, not programming languages and frameworks that a creative candidate with the fundamentals can learn in a few weeks anyway.

In addition to these "Ninja" coding interviews, Facebook also had a separate interview which tested high level system and architectural design ability, known as a "Pirate" interview. Like the "Ninja" the pirates tested creativity, the ability to think "outside-the-box" and not being married to fixed concepts and technology.

## B-grade Candidates

Organizations are complex organisms, with many people playing different roles. These roles coexist and collaborate, contributing to a common whole. For example, product teams at Facebook were a partnership between Software Engineers and Engineering Managers, Product Managers, Designers, Researches, and Data Scientists. It was impossible for a Engineer to do their job properly, without understanding and collaborting with, say, a Designer.

Hence, working in a complex organisation requires a set of social, behavioural and cultural skills that enable one to work well with others. B-grade candidates have all the core professional skills that C-grade candidates have, plus these social, behavioural and cultural skills.

At Facebook, these B-level skills were tested in an interview known as the "Jedi". Questions focussed on a wide range of behavioural situations, from resolving conflicts, to working in teams, to understanding the purpose and importance of other roles.

### On "Minders"

Many organisations underestimate the added value of B-level skills, and are happy to hire just C-grade candidates. This is usually not too serious for junior candidates (e.g. SWEs newly graduated from universities), but fast becomes a big problem as the candidate gets older, and acquires more responsibilities.

While it is possible for a junior SWEs interactions with the "outside world" (i.e. other roles) to be minimal, senior SWEs have to actively collaborate externally. C-grade candidates struggle at this, because they possess few social, behavioural and cultural skills. Often they cause conflicts, which tend to escalate into even larger conflicts.

Most organisations solve this problem by creating a "communications layer" between socially in-ept C-grade candidates, and the outside world — usually, in the form of a project manager. The additional overhead caused by these "minders" not only slow down the development process, but create unhealthy organisational tensions. For example, SWEs are constantly aware that their "minders" don't contribute ideas or intellectual property, but usually take the credit for their accomplishments.

## A-grade Candidates

The best candidates have, in addition to professional skills (C) and social, behavioural and cultural skills (B), the right mindset and motivation to work well in an organization. The best candidates believe in what the company does and want to contribute to that mission, irrespective of compensation and prestige (If a candidates too many questions about salary, and titles, that indicates that their motivations might not be completely aligned with the companies).

The best candidates are constantly trying to improve, and want to grow all the time. This "growth mindset" is what I mean by the right mindset. A-grade candidates tended to have strong philosophies about their own personal growth, and what they expected of organizations.

There was no dedicated interview for detecting A-level skills at Facebook. Instead, throughout the other interviewers ("Ninja", "Pirate", "Jedi") the interviews were constantly on the look out for evidence of A-level skills.

## Concluding thought: A-grade organisations

There is one clear advantage in hiring C-grade SWEs overs Bs or As; they are much cheaper. In Sri Lanka, a A-grade SWEs, straight out of university could have a starting salary of 180,000 LKR per month or more. On the other hand, there are C-grade SWEs with 10 years of experience earning less than a third of that.

Hence, many organisations that care more about shorter-term profits, will be happy to hire C-grade SWEs or less. These organisations, usually, don't produce new intellectual property, or product design, merely translate requirements specs (usually developed abroad) into code. While this model is still common, and has been historically dominant in Sri Lanka, it is quickly going away — especially with rising living standards locally, and developments such as AI globally.

To me, the future is one of A-grade SWEs and A-grade organisations (i.e. organisations that want to hire A-grade SWEs). Hence, I hope this primer will be useful!
