* A parasite is an entity that depends on another entity for its survival.

* DNA is a parasite, because it "survives" through the survival and reproduction of its host organisms. The organism might die, but the DNA survives in the organisms offspring.

* Ideas are also parasites. They live in the minds of people, and occasionally in other mediums like books, art and engineering.

## On surviving through survival

* Ideas survive through the survival of their hosts, and they often continue to "survive" after their hosts have died or have been destroyed, or are "like not cool any more".

* For a parasite to survive, it needs to live in its host long enough for the host to propagate the parasite to the next generation.

* (Until then) For a parasite to survive, it must be able to cohabit with its host, and promote the host's survival.

## On the two methods of human reproduction

* Human Ideas survive through Human reproduction. There are two methods of human reproduction: 1) Breeding children; 2) Breeding students, disciples or followers.

* Almost all humans are suited to breeding children. Our parasitic DNA enforces this. DNA that led to humans that were less likely to breed would not have survived.

* On the other hand, only a few humans are naturally suited to breeding students, disciples or followers.

* Both methods are effective. One is significantly more asymmetric than the other. The Buddha had only one son, who himself had no descendent. Conversely, there are over half a billion humans alive today who claim to be students, disciples or followers of the Buddha.

## On books, art and engineering

* Ideas are intellectual concepts, and need to be understood by their host humans. Hence, simple ideas are more likely to survive in human mediums, compared to more complex ideas.

* Complex ideas tend live in books. Many also tend to die in books.

* There are two types of books: Books that host many ideas, and books that repeat the same idea many times. The latter almost always outlives the former.

* Art is the art of making ideas beautiful. Art hosts ideas in a manner that is beautiful to the humans that surround it. Hence, those humans have an incentive to help that the art survives.

* When analysing a book, or a piece of art, or a bridge, it is difficult to judge whether the ideas they host are good or bad. On the other hand, it is easy to measure how long they have survived.

* The expected lifespan of an idea is proportional to age. Old ideas have longer life expectancies than newer ones, and are more likely to survive even longer.

## On intolerance

* All parasites compete for hosts. As do ideas.

* Ideas that help their hosts dominate others of their kind tend to survive more than ideas that don't.

* Ideas that are intolerant of other ideas tend to survive longer than tolerant ones.

* The ideas of liberalism, tolerance and intellectual freedom, that are promoted as representative of our age, are significant anomalies, considering broader human history. For almost 99% of our history, humans have been illiberal, intolerant, and intellectually bankrupt.

* There is no evidence or reason that this anomaly should survive long. It is either an anomaly, or these ideas are themselves in a schizophrenic and parasitic coexistent with a set of very different ideas.

## On the schizophrenia of ideas

* For a tolerant idea to survive it has to be coupled with an intolerant one, which enforces its survival.

* Liberalism has historically parasited itself on a conservative, white-centric and nationalistic host. More recently, this host has been replaced by a Neo-liberal and increasingly Alt-Left/Anti-fa host.

* Religions with a core of peace and tolerance (e.g. Buddhism, and New-Testament Christianity) have depended on nationalism and autocratic ideas for support and survival (e.g. For much their history, all majority Buddhist countries were autocratic monarchies which autocratically supported Buddhism). This is the only way these "tolerant" ideas can survive in the light of intolerant ideas (e.g. Religions that condone the enslaving, mistreatment, and killing of non-believers).

* Academic institutions that worship intellectual freedom, often have highly intolerant, and out-of-date administrations that suppress new ideas, in the interest of a narrow status quo, and a small set of "acceptable" ideas.

## Concluding thoughts

* Ideas must be seen for what they are: Parasites that have an ulterior motive — Survival. Both good ideas and bad ideas have this motive.

* It is easy to confuse a good idea, with one that has merely survived a long time. ("When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that's fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that's a religion" — Yuval Noah Hariri [2])

* There are many good ideas, e.g. Liberalism, Tolerance, Intellectual Honesty, that are generally bad at surviving — and might not survive for much longer. That does not make them bad ideas which are unworthy of a host.
