# Chained Melody

On the anatomy of tunes and ideas

## George Wilfred's famous melody

Think of any melody — say, the melody of the Sri Lankan National Anthem:

Suppose you sing, play or hum it from that starting G. At what point does it become recognizable as a particular melody?

A single G means little. Add a second note (another G), and still we have two isolated Gs. Add a third, an it is still G-G-F —i.e. not much. It is probably with the D-F-E♭phrase ending that Egodahage George Wilfred Alwis Samarakoon (a.k.a. Ananda Samarakoon)'s famous melody becomes finally recognisable.

## No note is an island

Hence, a single note is not a melody. Collections of notes become motivs which then gradually emerge into melodies. Melodies emerge into subjects, and subjects emerge into whole movements of music. Movements emerge into "pieces" of music.

With each step, music becomes more complex, and endures longer in time.

All of this requires time and memory. If one forgets how a melody began, then it ceases to be a melody. For example, "Sri Lanka Matha" would not be recognizable if we forgot the G-G-F by the time we got to the D-F-E♭.

This "need for memory" also applies in the opposite direction.

Consider the G at the beginning of "Sri Lanka Matha". In concert pitch, this G has a frequency of about 392Hz. Depending how exactly the sound is produced, it will take some wave form.

For example, this is what the wave would look like if produced by a tuning fork (Sine wave), a violin and a piano:

At a given moment in time, "sound" is just the position of particles of air. A particular sound only emerges when these particles move in the shape of a wave. This wave causes our ear-drums to move in concert, which is then sensed by our brains. Hence, just as no melody exists with an isolated note, no sound exists at an isolated point in time.

Hence by nature, all melodies are "chained melodies". They only acquire meaning from their context. Without this context they are meaningless. There is no such thing as an "absolute melody". All melodies are "relative" to all that is around it.

## The Cosmic Dance

But wouldn't this apply to any piece of information?

Just as a melody is made up of notes, a painting is made up of color. And just as a sound has no meaning at moment in time, nor does colour, which is also a vibrating electro-magmetic wave of a particular frequency.

And what about more complex pieces of information? Like ideas, values, and ethics? Are they any more absolute than the isolated G at the beginning of our national anthem?
