### 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election

## 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election

In A Brief History of Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections, I concluded with a hypothetical and unscientific prediction on how many seats each party would get in the 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election. Assuming that voting ran along the lines of the 2019 Presidential Election.

In this article, I attempt a more rigorous estimate. And attempt an answer to the question "Can the SLPP win a Super-Majority?"

## Methodology and Assumptions

### Assumption 1 — Base Vote Assumption

For each political party, I estimate the "base vote" of that party. A "base voter of a party" is a voter who will always vote for that party. Hence, each party is guaranteed of "base votes".

For each polling division, I assume the least proportion of votes the party got, historically, is a reasonable estimate of the base vote ("Base Vote Assumption). "Historically" means the last three elections (2004, 2010, 2015).

### Assumption 2 — Floating Vote Assumptions

The difference between the total vote and the base vote summed across all parties is the floating vote. These come from voters not "pledged" to any particular party. And hence could go to any party.

In the 2019 Presidential Election, the UNP won about 75% of the floating vote in the Northern and Eastern provinces, while SLPP won about 50% of the floating vote throughout the rest of the country.

In this analysis, I look at scenarios where the SLPP gets various proportions of the floating vote. From 0% to 100%. In each of these scenarios, I make the following assumptions ("Floating Vote Assumption"):

* In the Northern and Eastern Province, the TNA gets about 80% of the remaining floating vote, while the UNP gets 20%

* In the rest of the island, the UNP gets 60% of the remaining floating vote, and the JVP gets 40%.

For example, in the scenario where the SLPP gets 50% of the floating vote, in Colombo, the UNP will get 30% of the floating vote, and the JVP will get 20%.

### Assumption 3 — Alliance Assumption

Finally, I assume the following alliances:

* The EPDP, JHU and the CWC will ally with the SLPP

* The UPF, SLMC and Eastern Muslim parties will ally with the UNP

* The TNA and JVP will contest independently

Hence, we have four political groups: SLPP, UNP, TNA and JVP.

[Disclaimer: All three assumptions could be invalid in practice. Given the unpredictability of both politicians and voters. Hence, take these results with a pinch of NaCl.]

## Results

### The Worst-Case (for the SLPP)

If the SLPP alliance win 0% of the floating vote and only win their "base", they will still win 94 seats. Four seats ahead of the UNP alliance. Hence, it seems impossible that the UNP would win the next general election, even if the SLPP does very poorly.

### The 50% Case

Assuming the SLPP alliance won 50% of the floating vote islandwide (similar to what they gained during the 2019 Presidential Election), they would win 128 seats. A comfortable majority of +31 seats. But no ⅔ super-majority.

### The Best Case

In the best case, where the SLPP wins 100% of the floating vote, they would still win 157 seats. 7+ above the ⅔ super-majority limit of 150 seats. This case does seem unlikely, given that it would mean winning all of the floating votes in the Nothern and Eastern provinces.

## Conclusions

Even in the worse case, the SLPP should end-up the party with the most seats in parliament. They are likely to win a ½ absolute-majority comfortably. And have a not-unreasonable chance of winning a ⅔ super-majority.
