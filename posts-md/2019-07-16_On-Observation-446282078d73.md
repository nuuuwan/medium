# On Observation

### From Objective to Subjective

### Water and Rocks

Yosemite Valley [1] can be visited all year around. It is black and white, and infinite in winter; golden and mysterious in autumn; hot and smoky in summer. But I like it best in spring, when the rivers and waterfalls swell, when the trees and the grasses are at their greenest, and the sky at its bluest.

On one such spring visit, I was sitting by a river, watching water endlessly stream from under a bridge. I plunged my hand into the icy flow, and picked up a rock. I ran my fingers through its smoothness and shape; one only created by thousands (perhaps millions) of years of flowing water, the sound of which I could still hear.

What made the water the water, and the rock the rock?

The water was liquid; molecules moving about in formation; it was cold, which meant that its molecules moved slower than (say) had they been part of a hot bath. The flowing water had a rumbling, rustling sound, as its flow moved against the bed and banks of the river, disturbing the air around it, causing sound.

The rock, on the other hand was hard; molecules packed in solid formation. They also moved, but more slowly. It absorbed most light particles, except for the few reflected that gave it its unique glossy, grey colour. Not disturbing the air around it, the rock was as silent as a tomb.

### From a Changing Universe to Constant Forms

Hence, in my meditations by the river, I experienced many forms of matter: sights (the glossy, grey colour of the rock), sounds (the flowing water), and feelings (the smooth, hardness of the rock, and the icy coldness of the water). All these felt constant. The rock, for example, had, perhaps, held its colour and hardness for centuries. The water would have remained cold, at least, until the afternoon sun heated it up.

But these forms that appeared constant had an underlying reality that was constantly changing. For example, the rock was solid because its molecules vibrated in formation; it was cold because they moved slowly; and it was grey because it absorbed and reflected photons in a certain way.

At a single point or moment of time, these forms would have no meaning, because at a point in time, my senses would not know if a molecule was moving, or if light particles were reflected, or if the atmosphere was disturbed resulting in sound. All these forms were meaningless without observations or measurements that persisted in time.

Hence, my senses that sensed these forms, both recorded and simplified the world for me. They miraculously transformed a stream of changing information, into a constant colour, sound, hardness, or temperature that persisted in time and memory. These simplifications helped me make sense of and realize and comprehend a possibly incomprehensibly complex reality.

But there was a problem.

Was I actually observing reality? Or was I simply observing what I was observing? Was there something (anything?) objective underneath it all? Or was it an imagination? A mirror within a mirror?

### An Objective Universe to a Subjective Observer

I continued my thought experiment.

What were my senses actually doing? For example, did my senses 1) observe the universe all the time, in a continuous stream of observation? Or 2) did my senses observe the universe as a series of discrete snapshots?

Continuous observation must also imply that there was some notion of absolute time, and that the nature of form was relative to this absolute time. For example, "how fast a molecule vibrates" and as a result, whether something is hard, or soft, or hot, or cold, would be a function of this absolute time.

On the other hand, if the observations were a series of discrete snapshots, then the nature of form was also a function of this discrete set of observations. If the snapshots were frequent, a molecule would (appear to) vibrate more slowly, and would appear to be colder and harder. Slow-down the snapshots, and reality would have become softer and warmer.

The second hypothesis had even more startling consequences.

Suppose the universe was random and void of any meaning, like a sequence of random numbers. Just as the sequence could be sampled in such a way to imbibe meaning (e.g. I could sample the numbers 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8,...), a certain sequence of snapshots could imbibe a meaningless universe with a definite and apparently meaningful form. Furthermore, two different observers, with different sequences of snapshots could perceive the world in completely different ways.

Another observer could have been sitting where I was, and not see the beautiful Yosemite Valley, but Trafalgar Square, or the surface of Mars, or even something amazing or horrible I could not imagine.

### The Question of Observation

I decided, for arguments sake, to accept my discrete snapshots hypothesis. Several questions followed:

* Why do the snapshots occur the way they do? Can their nature be changed?

* Why do my senses simplify reality the way they do? For example, why is slow vibration interpreted as hard or cold, and not "red"?

* Was the simplification an attempt to simplify, or confound? That the changing was constant?

* Do the forms I see (colour, sound, hardness) have any absolute meaning or reality of their own?

* Is the universe real?

"Interesting questions..." I thought to myself. Yosemite continued in front of my eyes, ears and senses, beautiful as ever, with its water, and ancient rocks. Perhaps I'll answer them on another visit, I thought.

And I went back to marveling.
