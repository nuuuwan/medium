# On Company Culture

### How culture should be a meta-culture

Many people have asked me questions about company culture (i.e. the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a company): what a good company culture is, how a good company culture can be built and maintained, and why some companies have good cultures and others have bad ones.

When I left Facebook in 2017, I wrote a parting note to my collegues and the company, listing the most valuable things I had learnt working at Facebook. One of these valuable things was company culture.

Hence, I thought I'd share part of that parting note with a wider audience.

## "A Meta-Culture that earns its keep"

>>> Acquaintances working at other companies often question me about Facebook's "company culture", particular on how good it is, and why. My answer to (my view on) "The secret to Facebook's culture" sometimes confuses, even disappoints.

>>> What we have is a "meta-culture". Our culture is not constant, nor sacrosanct. Our culture at any given point of time, is whatever culture that will help us achieve our long-term mission in the most efficient way — obviously, subject to basic human decency and sense. A culture that served a 500-employee company well, might not be ideal for a 5,000-employee company. Hence, a successful culture constantly evolves with the successful organization it helps create.

>>> Like the teams, projects and products that help us achieve our mission, our culture must earn its keep. If a project is failing, we kill it, and move onto something better. The same applies to culture, and I'm proud of the times we've acknowledged that something in our culture was not right, renewed ourselves, and moved on — a stronger and better company.

## Meta-Culture Dos and Don'ts

Given that I believe that a good culture is not constant, nor sacrosanct, I can't recommend or pontificate on what a good culture is or what a bad culture is. A good culture is company and time dependent. No one culture fits all.

However, I'd like to embellish my 2017 write-up with some additional principles that might be useful.

* Do hire good people. Culture is very much a function of people. Hire good people, and you'll (more or less) have a good culture.

* Do work on culture. Culture needs work. Problems rarely fix themselves, and usually get worse if not solved. Bad culture is a bad problem; if it is ignored or condoned, it will get worse.

* Do have good incentives. Culture adapts to stimuli. If the company has a bad cultural practice, but there is no disincentive to discourage this, that practice will go on. Good incentives encourage good culture. Bad incentives encourage bad culture.

* Don't worship cultural precepts too much. If they are sacrosanct, getting rid of them becomes blasphemous. As your company evolves, some once suitable precepts will become unsuitable. You can't get rid of something unsuitable, if it is also sacrosanct.

* Don't make culture an end. "Having some culture X" is never the mission of a company. It is merely a means that will help achieve that mission efficiently. Don't sacrifice your mission chasing after some particular culture.
