# The "Map"

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

There has been some controversy over various maps depicting the results of the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election. The "Eelam"-word has come up several times, and parts of the country have been accused of disloyalty.

I also got "feedback" about the "potentially divisive nature" of the map I used for my "real-time" updates:

## "Win" Maps

At the end of the day, only one map actually matters. The SLPP's Gotabhaya Rajapaksa won with 52.2% of the vote. True — not as much as President Kumaratunga's 62.28% in 1994. But there's no such thing as a 52.2% president. A president is a president.

The SLPP "won" (i.e. got more votes) in all but the Northern and Eastern provinces.

At an Electoral District level, it won all but the five electoral districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces and the Nuwara-Eliya district.

Of the 160 polling divisions, the SLPP won 114, to the NDFs 46.

## More Nuanced Maps

But obviously, these maps are incomplete. "Winning" a polling division, electoral district, or province doesn't imply that everyone there voted for you. Nor does "losing" imply that no-one did.

If we use a continuous colour palette, we get far more nuanced maps:

## Even Better Maps

But even these maps are misleading because democracy involves "one person with one vote", not "one square-kilometre, with one vote". Densely populated parts of the country are underrepresented in this map.

A even better representation is this Dorling Cartogram:

The area of each circle is proportional to the number of total votes in the polling division. The label denotes the electoral district of the polling division (e.g. "Co" is Colombo).

## Concluding Reflections

On the one had, a map is a map. No map is a perfect representation. And reading too much into maps is a waste of time. As is reading too much into any model. That fallacy is known as "false-precision". Or seeing things that don't exist.

On the other hand, maps are highly emotive entities. A line or shade in the wrong place can ignite many hearts.

So, I advise myself, map with care!
