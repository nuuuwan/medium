"How old are you, O King?", said the Arahat. "42 years, next full moon, Sir", replied the King.

"42", mused the Arahat. And then asked, "What sort of number is that?""It is an even integer, Sir", replied the King.

"And are there others besides that?""Sir, yes, Sir", said the King. "There are many, indeed an infinite number, of even integers".

"And besides those?", questioned the Arahat."There are odd intergers, Sir", said the King.

"And besides all these integers even and odd?""Well, Sir", said the King, "There are other rational numbers, that are not integers. Like 2/3. Which, incidentally, is the majority my PM has in Parliament, Sir"

"My namesake", said the Arahat, ruefully. "Yes. I've heard of that one. And besides?""My PM?...Oh, you mean rational numbers. Yes, there are other numbers, Sir".

"Such as?""Well, irrational numbers, Sir. Like the length in spans of the diagonal of a square, where each side is one span. That number is a little less than one and one-half spans. But cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Indeed, I can prove it. A simple matter of contradiction..."

"Yes, yes", said the Arahat, hastily. "Don't let that fellow Pythogoras hear you. He might drown you as he did Hippasus."

"And besides all these, O King?", continued the Arahat. "Well, Sir", said the King. "There might be numbers that have not been invented as yet. The square root of a negative number, for instance."

"Yes, O King", said the Arahat. "I've also thought about those. But for brevity, and without any loss of generality, let's ignore these and leave them for some future discussion and, perhaps, generation. Any other numbers that have been invented?" "You mean, besides other even integers, odd integers, rational numbers and irrational numbers, Sir?", replied the King.

"Yes, O King", said the Arahat. "Why yes, Sir.", said the King. "There is 42, Sir. My age next full moon".

"Thou has shown great wit, O ruler of men!", said the Arahat. "Why, thank you, Sir!", said the King.
