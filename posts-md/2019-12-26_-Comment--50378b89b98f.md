[Comment]

The main problem I address is one of Sri Lankan National Identity (or the lack of one). It is a problem faced by all Sri Lankans, including the Sinhala and Buddhist majorities.

I don't explicitly address any other problems faced by minorities, or majorities. Social, political or economic.

I haven't suggested a solution to the Identity Problem. Though I do suggest that Sri Lankan identity is being superseded by a Sinhala Buddhist Identity. This is not because I want it to, but because it is what is happening. There is a void, and it is being filled.

If you believe that I agree and support with what is happening, then you would be correct. I would be supporting racism.

But then, I neither agree, nor support.
