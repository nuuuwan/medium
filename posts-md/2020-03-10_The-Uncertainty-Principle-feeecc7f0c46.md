# The Uncertainty Principle

### Of Knowledge

## Chandrika the President

>>> Doctor: "Who is our president?"Patient: "Chandrika Kumaratunge"Doctor: "What year is it?"Patient: "1995"

This conversation would have been unexceptional in 1995. But it wasn't had in 1995. It happened a few weeks ago. And the president is Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

The patient had recently had a brain injury, which wiped out 25 years of her memory. She believed it was 2005. She was sincere and convinced.

Have you suffered from an episode like this? You think not? Let me jog your memory with an example. Do you remember this conversation?

## Tommy the Good

>>> Me: Is Tommy a good accountant? You: Yes! He has a spotless record. Competent, honest and discrete. Me: But he could spoil his record in the future, right? If he, for example, gets involved in some scandal? You: But his record now is spotless. Me: How long have you known him?You: We go way back. We were at school together. Best friends. Until he went to the US. About 25 years ago. Me: Why did he move back to Sri Lanka? You: I don't know. He wanted to be closer to family?Me: So you didn't hear about the Aurus? You: What's Aurus?Me: The reason Tommy lost his accountants' licence?

What do these two episodes have in common? The principle is the same "knowledge loss". A severe car accident caused the first. Ignorance caused the second. In both cases, both people lost 25 years of knowledge

But who exactly is the President? Gotabaya Rajapaksa or Chandrika Kumaratunga? Well, it depends. If you clarify, "The President, now", then it would be GR. But without this clarification, the question has no precise answer.

You might say that I'm quibbling about semantics. And of course, you are right. But with most questions, I'd be right to quibble. Because when we ask questions, we don't know what we are asking. And when I ask you a question, you might answer a different question.

For example, when I asked "Is Tommy a good accountant?" you answered the question "Was Tommy a good accountant 25 years ago?". As the patient answered the question, "Who was the President 25 years ago?"

So, is Tommy a "good accountant". Well, that depends. 25 years ago, he seemed to have been a good one. Then he blotted is copybook in New York, and became a "bad accountant". And now he's back in Sri Lanka, back to being a "good accountant" (at least by local reputation) it seems.

The answer is precise at single points of time. Like 25 years ago, or now. But considering Tommy's entire career, the answer various and ambiguous.

## Conclusions: Adolf the Socialist

Let me conclude with Hitler.

>>> The "Libertarian": Socialism is the worst. Me: What are some good examples of socialism? The "L": Hitler. He was a socialist. Do you want the US to be like Nazi Germany?

There are two underlying questions: "Is socialism a bad thing?" and a more profound question "What is socialism?"

The "L" believed that socialism was bad. But his view was also based on a specific and narrow definition of socialism. He was either ignorant or was "blocking out" less unfavourable examples of socialism.

What has Hitler got to do with car accidents and dodgy accountants?

If you want to say something "certain", you have no choice but to restrict yourself to a narrow context. If your definition of socialism is Hitler's national socialism, then socialism is terrible. If you judged him on his record 25 years ago, then Tommy is a good accountant. If it is 1995, then Chandrika Kumaratunge is the president.

If you want to see a broader context, then what you say is likely to be various, ambiguous and uncertain. You will use "that depends", clarifying definitions, nuance and invoke randomness.

Or in other words:

>>> The broader one's knowledge, the less certain one is. One cannot have both broad knowledge and certainty.

Or as MacGyver said:

>>> "Only a fool is sure of anything; a wise man keeps on guessing."
