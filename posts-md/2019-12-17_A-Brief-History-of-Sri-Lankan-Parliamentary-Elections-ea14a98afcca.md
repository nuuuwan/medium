# A Brief History of Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections

### 1989 to 2015

In this article, I review the seven parliamentary elections, held under the proportional representation (PR) system. For context, I begin with a historical prelude.

## Prelude: Before 1989

Sri Lanka's first Parlimentary election was held in 1947. This was followed by '52, '56, March '60, July '60, '65, and '70.

The 8th election should have been held in 1975, given that the previous election was held in 1970. Instead, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike took advantage of the new 1972 constitution. And delayed the vote by two years. To 1977.

### 1977

By '77, the ruling SLFP was deeply unpopular. While "closed" economic policies led to some development of local industry, unemployment was high and essential goods in short supply. The opposition UNP had regrouped after its 1970 defeat and promised opening-up the economy.

The UNP won 50.92% of the vote, and140 of the 168 seats. A 5/6ths majority. While the SLFP won 29.72%, it could manage only 8 seats.

Several Federalist Tamil parties merged to form the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). And won all 14 seats in the Northern Province. And another four seats in the Eastern Province, for a total of 18 seats.

For the first time in history, a Tamil party won the second-highest number of seats. And became the official opposition.

### 1982 Referendum

The 1978 constitution created an executive presidency and expanded parliament to 225 members. It also replaced "first-past-the-post" (FPTP) with proportional representation (PR) in the parliamentary election.

To maintain a parliamentary super-majority, the UNP proposed extending the parliament by six years, to 1989. The 4th amendment was passed in parliament and was then upheld by the supreme court. On condition that it passed a public referendum.

Hence, five years after 1977, a referendum was held on December 22nd, 1982 in place of a general election. 54.66% voted in favour. While 45.34% voted against. Hence, parliament extended to 1989.

## 1989

1989 was the first election help under the new PR system.

The General Election polled amidst chaos. The LTTE waged war in the north and east. The JVP insurrected in many other parts of the country. Turnout was just 63.60%. Down from 70.82% during the 1982 referendum.

The UNP with 50.71%, won a similar share of the vote to 1977. But with the new PR system, won only 125 of 225 seats (55.55%). An absolute majority, but no super-majority.

The SLFP won 31.90% of the vote and 67 seats.

The Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) and TULF, won 13 and 10 seats respectively. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) won 4 seats.

The United Socialist Alliance (comprising of the CP, the LSSP, the NSSP and the SLMP), and the MEP won three seats each.

## 1994

Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's 1994 wins in the general and presidential elections marked the end of 17 years of UNP rule. Years marked by terror, corruption and two civil conflicts. The people demanded change at the ballot box.

The general election was held on August 16th, with a 76.24% turnout. Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's People's Alliance (PA), consisting of the CP, LSSP, SLMP and SLFP, won 48.94% and 105 seats. Eight short of the 113 required for a majority in parliament.

The UNP (which also included the CWC) won 44.04% and 94 seats. The EPDP, TULF and TELO (an alliance of EROS, PLOTE and TELO) won 9, 5 and 3 seats respectively. The SLMC won 7 seats. The JVP and UPFC won a seat each.

Despite no absolute majority, the PA formed a government, helped by EPDP and SLMC support.

## 2000

The PA government failed to meet expectations. It failed to make peace with the LTTE. The war was as brutal as ever. The hated executive presidency was not abolished. And, perhaps decisively, the economy had ground to a halt.

2000 was one of the most violent of elections. Seventy people were killed, including six on election day, October 10th. The PA was also accused of fraud and intimidation.

A broader PA alliance, which included the SLMC, the MEP, and the CWC (which had previously allied with the UNP) won 45.11% of the vote, and 107 seats. The UNP (including the UPFC) won 40.22% of the vote and 89 seats.

The JVP won 10 seats. The TULF, EPDP, TELO and ACTC won 5, 4, 3 and 1 seat respectively. The SLMC (contesting separately in Digamadulla and Trincomalee) won 4 seats. The new Sihala Urumaya (SU) won 1 seat.

With no majority, parliament was in impasse. Another election followed soon.

## 2001

Elections were held on December 5th, 2001. Just 421 days after the previous general election.

The PA suffered several setbacks in the lead-up to the election. Most of the SLMC left the coalition. 13 SLFP members defected to the UNP. Angered by the parties effort to court the JVP, supposedly.

2001 was as violent as 2000. 46 people were killed in the lead-up to polling day, and another 14 on polling day itself.

The UNF alliance (including the UNP, SLMC, CWC and UPFC) won 45.62% of the vote, and 109 seats. The PA (which now missed the SLMC) won 37.19% and 77 seats.

The JVP won 16 seats. The Tamil National Alliance (consisting of the ACTC, EPRLF, TELO and TULF) won 15 seats. The SLMC (contesting from the UNF in Ampara, Batticaloa and Jaffna) won 5 seats. The EPDP and PLOTE won 2 and 1 seat respectively.

With its SLMC allies, the UNP-led alliance won a paper-thin majority.

## 2004

A president and prime minister from two different parties led to total disfunction. And hence, parliament dissolved in 2004. And elections were called for April 2nd.

The PA rebranded as the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and was joined by the JVP. It won 45.60% of the vote, and 105 seats.

The UNF won 37.83% and 82 seats.

The TNA won 22 seats. The Sinhala Heritage (Hela Urumaya) party, which had since morphed into the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), with the inclusion of several Buddhist monks as MPs, won 9 seats. The SLMC (contesting separately from the UNF in the Eastern Province and Jaffna) won 5 seats. The EPDP and the UPFC (now separate from the UNF) won a seat each.

Despite lacking a majority, crossovers from several SLMC MPs and the CWC gave the UPFA a working majority.

## 2010

Since 2004, parliament was the stage for multiple crossovers and counter-crossovers. In June 2005, the JVP (consisting of 39 MPs), left the UPFA. In January 2006, 4 UNP MPs joined the UPFA. In January 2007, 18 UNP MPs, 6 SLMC MPs and the JHU joined the UPFA. In December 2007, 4 SLMC MPs quit the UPFA. In December 2008, 12 JVP MPs who'd previously quit the UPFA, rejoined branding themselves as the NFF.

Hence, at most times, the UPFA enjoyed a stable-enough majority in parliament.

As expected, following the conclusion of the 30-year-war in May 2009, and Mahinda Rajapaksas resounding presidential election win on January, the UPFA was expected to win a landslide at the 2010 general election.

The UPFA won a whopping 60.33% of the vote and 144 seats (just six short of a 2/3rds majority). UNF won 29.34% and 60 seats. The TNA won 14 seats. The JVP won 7 seats.

Later that year, with the support of some opposition MPs, the UPFA was able to garner 2/3rds of parliament needed to pass the 18th amendment.

## 2015

Following Maitripala Sirisena's surprise win in the January Presidential Election, his 100-day "reform program" promised to dissolve parliament on April 23rd. In actuality, parliament disbanded in June, and elections were scheduled for August 17th.

The UNP-led UNFGG (United National Front for Good Governance), won 45.66% of the vote and 106 seats. The UPFA 42.38% and 95 seats. The TNA 16 seats. The JVP 6 seats. The SLMC (contesting separate from the UNFGG in Batticaloa and Vanni) and the EPDP won a seat each.

A few days after the election, the SLFP agreed to form a national government with the UNFGG for a period of two years.

## Postlude: 2020

The exact date has not been set for the 2020 election, though it is rumoured to be in March, April or May. Constitutionally it must be held before December 1st, 2020.

If we (hypothetically and unscientifically) assume, that voting at the next general election is similar to the 2019 Presidential Election, and also assign the seats the UNF gains in the Northern Province and the Trincomalee District to the TNA, and those in the Batticaloa District to the SLMC, the "Seats by Party" would be as follows:
