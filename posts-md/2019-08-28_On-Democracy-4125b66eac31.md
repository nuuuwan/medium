# On Democracy

### From first principles

Sri Lanka is bracing itself for yet another presidential election. Party faithfuls are getting behind one or the other party. Others are contemplating backing a third, perhaps even fourth horse. As usual, "democracy", "the survival of democracy', and "the threats to the survival of democracy" are hot topics, at least amongst the (self proclaimed) englightened classes.

Hence, I thought it a good time to reflect on democracy in general, and Sri Lankan democracy in particular.

## Equal Power

Democracy is (for me) a system of government where political power is shared equally amongst the citizen. Or a system of government where all citizens have equal power.

To better understand anything, it is usually useful to compare it with its alternatives. So what are some alternatives to democracy

* Autocracy, (power in the hands of) one person

* Meritocracy, people with merit, skill, or academic ability (very similar to Technocracy)

* Monarchy, a monarch

* Oligarchy, a small number of people, usually rich

* Plutocracy, the wealthy

* Theocracy, religious leaders

* Representative Democracy, a few representatives chosen by the people

All these alternatives have two things in common:

* All concentrate power in the hands of a few

* They all have some justifiable rationale for this "concentration process" (at least to their supporters). For example, supporters of Meritocracy might say that PhDs in Engineering, Bio-Chemistry, or Economics make better leaders. Supporters of representative democracy often claim that most people don't know how to govern a country, and hence must leave it to the experts. Supporters of Monarchy claim that the monarch has a divine right to govern (whatever that means).

The problem will all of these alternatives is that these "justifiable rationales" rarely hold up. For example, meritocrats who might be very smart at somethings end up being very stupid at most other things; "Representatives" often end up being incompetent, corrupt or worse. Hence, there is no effective way to concentrate power in the hands of a few.

The only alternative to these alternatives is democracy in its purest form: Equal power to all citizens. We solve the "concentration" problem by picking a system that has no concentration.

Hence, democracy has one and only one justification: it is better than all other forms of government.

## How to promote democracy in Sri Lanka

There is a very easy way to measure if Democracy is declining: if there is more inequality of power, then there is less democracy (by definition).

Conversely, the way to make a country more democratic, is to increase equity of power. This can be done in a combination of ways:

* Equity. Political power goes hand in hand with economic power. Many "democracies" like Sri Lanka are, to a large extent, controlled by small elites of wealthy, influential people. Law and Order, and Institutions are, to a large extent, subservient to these elites. The most effective way to create an equitable society is to make institutions, and law and order, strong, and this elite weak.

* Enlightenment. Democracy works best when the population is intelecually rich. Sri Lanka, for example, is still somewhat backward in terms of intellectual freedom. Philosophy and thought are still very much grounded in religious texts and feudal or colonial identities. Technology and the internet have mostly made things worse. We need to find ways of turning this around, including finding more enlightening uses of technology.

* Identity. A lone man on an island has no use for a system of government, or democracy. Conversely, democracy only makes sense, if the people of a country decide that there is some value in prospering as a country. Sri Lanka has no national identity. We have various racial, religious, caste, and class identities, but these always trump the national identity. Hence, everyone is more Sinhala, Buddhist, Govigama, "English-Speaking", "Royalist" or "Colombo Educated" than they are Sri Lankan. Our country needs a strong identity and, perhaps, some unifying story.

* Development. Economic, social and political development which promotes Equity, Enlightenment and Identity is a sort of "blanket" strategy that will help many of the components of democracy. While Sri Lanka has achieved significant development in the last couple of decades, the job is by no means complete. We should focus on continued development, particularly in terms of technology, product development and intellectual property.

Hence, for me, this is how we can promote democracy: ultimately by promoting power equity.

## Concluding Thoughts

Voting in presidential elections is a very small part of democracy. If we vote in such away that our (the peoples) political power is given away and futher concentrated in the hands of a few, then that is not democracy. On the other hand, if some short-term concentration will result in long-term equity, then that is still progress to some extent. And yes, this is a paradox. But complex topics are full of paradoxes.

Perhaps that is the most important takeaway: a system of government is complex, and so is the business of elections, and democracy in general.

If you think it is simple, then you've probably got it wrong.
