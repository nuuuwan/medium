# On why we sense

### Coincidence, Correlation, and Causation

## On Breaking Glasses

There is a glass of water on the table in front of me.

Scenario 1: Suppose I knock it over. It would then fall to the floor, and smash to pieces. I would have "caused" the glass to break. This is "causation".

Scenario 2: Now, suppose, whenever you walk into a room and find me in that room, you also happen to find a broken glass on the ground. You might get suspicious. It might look like I cause glasses to break. But you don't really know that I caused the glass to break. It's just that "Nuwan is in the room" and "There is a broken glass on the floor" are "correlated".

Actually, there might be no "statistically significant evidence" for a correlation even. In which case, it would merely be a "coincidence".

Scenario 3: Now, suppose that I am a janitor. And whenever a glass breaks, it is my job to do the cleaning. And so, you turn up in a room, there is a broken glass, and I also have turned-up to clean up the mess. This is also "causation" — but in this case, the "broken glass" caused "me" (to be in the room).

## Conditions for causation

When could we say that A caused B? Several, conditions would need to hold.

* Condition 1: Both A and B must have happened. For example, "Nuwan happens to be in the room", and "The breaking of the glass has happened".

* Condition 2: A must have happened before B. For example, "Nuwan happened to be in the room, before the glass broke"

* Condition 3: There must be some process by which A caused B. For example, "Nuwan caused the glass to break by knocking it over, and making it fall to the floor".

If any of these conditions don't hold, then there is no "causation". For example, in Scenario 1, all the conditions are true; in Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, only Condition 1 is true.

## Sensing the universe

By "sensing the universe", I mean our body's ability to see, hear, feel, smell and taste.

Why do we see? What do we have eyes?

An evolutionary biologist would say the "cause" for our eyes was a "need to see". Humans have very complex eyesight. Some animals, like eagles, have even better eyesight. Trees have basic "sight", being able to distinguish light from darkness — but little else. Many microbial organisms are utterly insensitive to light, and hence, have no eyesight.

Hence, over millions of years, various organisms acquired varying degrees of sight depending on need and the random iterations of evolutions. In our "Conditions for causation" scheme,

* Condition 1: Bodies need to see, and there are examples of organisms with bodies with eyes that see (like humans)

* Condition 2: There was a "need to see by bodies" before "eyes evolved".

* Condition 3: Evolution was the process by which eyes evolved, where, through many generations, organisms with bodies with better eyes survived and reproduced, while others died out.

In summary, we have senses, because "Our senses helped our bodies survive".

## A look in the mirror

But what about the opposite. While it is true that "our senses helped our bodies survive", it is also true that "Our bodies helped our senses survive".

For example, there won't be "Homo Sapiens eyes" today, if Homo Sapiens died out thousands of years ago, and there were no Homo Sapiens bodies. The same applies for all types of "eyes", even the rudimentary "eyes" that trees have.

But then, who is the master and who is the slave? Do our senses serve our bodies, or do our bodies serve our senses? As opposed to saying "The need for seeing, caused our bodies to evolve eyes", should we instead say, "The need for seeing, caused our eyes to evolve bodies"?

What does that even mean? If the latter statement is true, our "Conditions for Causality" would look like:

* Condition 1: Eyes need to see, and there are examples of eyes with bodies with organisms that see (like my eyes, and your eyes)

* Condition 2: There was a "need to see by eyes" before "bodies evolved".

* Condition 3: X was the process by which bodies evolved, where, through many iterations, eyes with better bodies with better organisms persisted, while others didn't.

I can't prove any of these conditions. Nor can I explain what "an eye without a body" is, or what the mysterious "X" is.

But, more interestingly, nor can I disprove the "Conditions of Causality".

Did I break any glass? Perhaps the mirror?
