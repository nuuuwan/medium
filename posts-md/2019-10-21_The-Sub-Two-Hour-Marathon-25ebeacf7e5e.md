# The Sub-Two-Hour Marathon

Why Eliud Kipchoge's run was so special

On the 12th of October, at the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya became the first human to run a Marathon (42.195 km) in under two hours, completing the distance in one hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds.

To be fair, Ineos was an unofficial event. The official rules were somewhat bent to maximise the chances of breaking the 2 hour barrier. Everything from route, to location, to weather, to footware was optimized. Hence, the performance will not update the official marathon world record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds, also held by Kipchoge.

But the performance is still very special. Many scientists believed that it was anatomically impossible for a human to run 42.195 km in less two hours. They have ben proved wrong.

Kipchoge's average speed of 5.88 meters per second (m/s), would also have achieved the world record for every race from the 3000m to the half-marathon, at various points in the last 100 years.

For example, the record average speed for the 3000m in 1920 was 5.85 m/s. For the 5000m in 1920 was 5.70m/s, and in 1940 was 5.89 m/s, marginally faster than Kipchoge's time. For the 10,000m, the record average speed in 1960 was 5.85 m/s. And the record for the half-marathon in 1980 was 5.62m/s.
