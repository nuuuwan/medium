# The Creativity Conjecture

### On Hard-Boiled Eggs and Piano Miniatures

All Machines, including computers, even the most sophisticated super-computers, follow instructions; instructions designed and written by humans. Sometimes the connection between these instructions, and the machine's final behaviour or output might not be obvious, but a precise and deterministic relationship exists, nonetheless. Hence, in summary, machines follow instructions and end-up doing productive things.

Humans are also productive, sometimes as a result of following instructions. For example, this morning, I "produced" two hard-boiled eggs by following the precise instructions of "boiling two eggs for 7 minutes". Obviously, humans are also capable of following more elaborate instructions and being more productive.

Whenever a human is productive by following instructions, it is almost always possible to design a machine that does the same thing, often faster, and more cheaply. I'm sure a hard-boiled egg making machine exists, though I don't own one.

But now for something completely different.

Last evening, I wrote a short piece of music for the piano. I didn't follow any instructions to write it. I happened to be doodling on the keys, and a piece of music, just "came to me". I could record the piece and share it on iTunes. Alternatively, I could transcribe it into sheet music, and possibly sell it. Either way, in this example also, I (a human) have been productive. But, this time, I didn't follow instructions.

As with boiling eggs, humans are also capable of being productive, without following instructions, and in ways where it is impossible to provide instructions. While I could, in theory, design a machine that boils eggs, I could not design one that would produce genuinely creative music.

Now you might say,

>>> "But wait. There are machines that compose music. You once designed one [1]"

Yes — that's true. And many of these machines pass "intelligence" tests like the Turing Test [2]. So, what exactly do I mean by "I could not design one [a machine] that would produce genuinely creative music."?

I am less interested in the result (what) and more interested in the process (how). Hence, I actually mean, "I could not design one [a machine] that would produce genuinely creative music, the way humans do".

You might retort:

>>> "But who cares how the machine does it, as long as what it produces is useful and possibly better than what humans produce?"

The key phrase here is "possibly better".

I conjecture that there is a class of human activity (let's call it the class of "creative activity") with the following properties:

* It is not known how to reduce the activity into a set of instructions

* The result of this activity is superior to those produced by machines

This conjecture is what I mean by the "Creativity Conjecture".

Hard-boiled egg anyone?
