### Democracy and Power

## Sponsored Content

Facebook and Twitter (the companies) are debating how they should treat political content. Especially ahead of the 2020 US Election. "Sponsored" content is particularly sensitive. But also "Organic" material. Especially content bordering on "Fake News".

There is a thin line between "Sponsored" and "Organic". When a post is "Sponsored" or "boosted" on the Facebook Newsfeed, it is "ranked" higher, relative to other non boosted content. "Ranking" is the process that decides what content appears on the feed. It sorts all available content into a queue. And displays the items at the top. "Sponsored" content get to jump the queue. The more advertising dollars spent, the more jumps. In other words, sponsoring biases ranking in favour of sponsored content.

But suppose there was no sponsored content. Facebook and Twitter still need ranking, as there is more content than space to show it. The ranking criteria are complex and evolving. It is a combination of how users engage with the content and its quality. These concepts are subjective. And, depending on your viewpoint, biased. Even without sponsoring.

## Unofficial Advertising

I was reading the "business" page of a newspaper. As expected, it had many advertisements. Some well designed, others not so well. These advertisements appeared between "articles".

But something didn't feel right. All the articles were "positive". They all described companies or projects but had only good things to say about them. Another international award. Another goal-beating quarter.

Of course, I should have expected this. The "articles" were also advertisements. I don't know what the deals between the paper and the businesses were. Something like "If you say nice things about us, we will buy more ads?" I don't know. But either way, the paper was creating "bias" in favour of the businesses.

## The "Unbiased" Newspaper

But suppose the newspaper had "integrity", and didn't indulge in quid pro quo ("something for something"), like an online feed with no sponsored content.

As an online feed has ranking, a newspaper has a complex news selection process. From people who access bits and pieces of news. To those who determined what small subset appears on the front page. And the rest of the paper. These people also have their own biases. Political, Social, and Economic.

Hence, as ranking biases a newsfeed, a newspaper's internal process biases its articles. They might say, "We are what we publish". "We publish what we are" is closer to the truth.

## What does "unbiased" mean?

It's not illegal or even unethical for newspapers have biases. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have leaned left and right-wing, respectively. But most people consider them intelligent and useful sources of news. But why do we say one leans left, and the other right?

Partly, a set of absolute ideas around left and right "wing-ness". There are some ideas that the NYT will always suppose. Others that the WSJ will. But "wing-ness" is also tied in the present content. If all newspapers were "left-wing" then we won't call out the NYT as left-wing.

The present contexts depend on the views of the world. At the present moment. Compared to the 19th century, all newspapers were more "left-wing" in the 20th century. In the 21st century, thus far, there is more polarisation, while the "average wing-ness" hasn't changed. The left-wings are more left-wing. The rights more right.

But my point is this. "Bias" is always relative to some baseline. The present context determines this baseline.

And what determines the present context?

## Bias and Power

In the last decade, we have seen the bizarre phenomenon of YouTube millionaires. People whose videos go viral, transforming them into instant celebrities. Along with the millions of advertising dollars that follow. But YouTube (and other social media) millionaires are rare. For every success, a million failures exist. With almost identical videos and histories. Winners and losers of the YouTube lottery.

Despite their humble beginnings, these millionaires have an enormous influence on the internet. They "influence" what people do, think and even feel. Most importantly, they influence the contextual baseline that determines bias.

While some win power in a lottery, others inherit power. Others (claim to) win power by merit, hard-work or skill. Like YouTube millionaires, other millionaires and billionaires also define the baseline of bias. In Silicon Valley, most of the billionaires are "left-wing". And the baseline is also so.

## Bias and Democracy

Ideally, democracy is a "One person, one vote" system. And in spirit, this "vote" is not only a vote but a unit of power. Every human has an equal amount of power. This power applies to thinking, speaking and doing. For example, in an ideal democracy, everyone should have the same enlightenment and education. They should have the same freedom of expression. And they should have the same freedom to act.

The "bias" we've discussed in this article, erodes the innate equity of democracy. While many countries boast the token "one person, one vote", the biases of power skews history in favour of a few.

I'm not arguing that inequity is a bad thing. Or democracy is a good thing. I'm pointing out that the two are contradictory. Freedom is not possible in a billionaire owned world.

## On Advertising

Advertising in general and political advertising, in particular, have a bad reputation. But they are not the disease, but a symptom. The virus (if I may call it that) is the bias of power. And the symptom is not only advertising but everything we read, think and feel. They are all biased by power.

Again, I'm not arguing that something is good or bad. I'm pointing out what is what is.
