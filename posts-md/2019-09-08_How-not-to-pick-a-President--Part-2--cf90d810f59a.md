# How not to pick a President (Part 2)

### Some self criticisms

In my article, How not to pick a President, I discussed some cognitive biases that tend to influence how people vote. I discussed,

* Extreme Event Bias, including how so many people voted for Mahinda Rajapakse, just because he "won the war".

* Anchor Bias, including how so many people vote "always for the UNP" or whatever party or family affiliation

* Familiarity Bias, including how people are deeply influenced by shallow tactics like posters

Related in Who do you side with?, I discussed how two party, binary politics dominate so many countries, and how the "lesser of two evils" binary thinking stifles rational democracy.

The attitude I showed was that people with cognitive biases, and can't think beyond binary politics are stupid (and implicitly) less smarter than me. In other words, I seemed to imply the following:

* People who voted for Mahinda Rajapakse just be cause he "won the war" are dumb

* People who always vote Green or always vote Blue are dumb

* People who are influenced by posters and prime-time TV are dumb

* People who can only vote for one of the two dominant parties are dumb

But when I reflect on these points, particularly in the context of Sri Lanka's presidential election in 2019, I am also struck by the following:

* No third party (except criticize the main parties) has proposed a credible plan on how to govern the country. I haven't even hear a plan for a plan as yet. Have you?

* There has been no plan for educating the public on politics and civcs. So can we criticize posters and TV shows by moron presenters, without proposing something better?

* We "won the war" is a memorable phrase. Is there any inspiring alternative which can rally the people? And has it been ever said by someone who the people know and trust?

* Finally, can we even have national politics without national identity? Is there any point in optimizing national politics (and related optimizations like reducing corruption), without building national identity?

At least for me, food for thought. Bon Appétit!
