# The Price of Cars

### How do cars retain value over time?

Since moving to Sri Lanka, I have not owned a car. Mostly due to my work circumstances. Parking in Fort is difficult and expensive. And it has always been easier to hail a taxi.

But is it cheaper?

A friend and I were debating this. If you own a personal car, there is the initial price, fuel, insurance and maintenance. The actual value of the vehicle offsets these costs. Which you would sell later. If you ride taxis, there is a taxi fare. For fairness, we should also consider other factors. For example, if you ride taxis, there is the "comfort benefit" of not having to drive. Conversely, if you own a car, there are conveniences like storage and consistency.

My friend and I agreed on most of the costs and benefits. But one factor we could not agree on was the "value" of the car.

My friend claimed that "in Sri Lanka" cars were investments "like land". And usually the value of a car went up or at least stayed fixed. You could buy a car, and then hope to sell it in a few years, "for the same price".

This seemed a bit sanguine to me. But rather than dismissing the claim, I thought of pulling some data to answer the question: How do cars retain value over time?

## Methodology and Results

I scraped newspapers and magazines online for buy and sell advertisements for used cars. I tracked the averages of buy and sell prices for various makes and models of vehicles over time. For simplicity, I ignored millage and accessories. I assumed with a large enough sample, these factors would cancel out.

I computed value on January 1, 2017, and then three years later, or today. January 1, 2020.

### Toyota Prius

Here's how the price of Toyota Prii changed during the last three years. I had statistically significant data for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 models.

For example, the 2012 model was about Rs. 5.3M beginning of 2017, and now sells for about Rs. 4.2M.

### Suzuki Swift

### Annual Depreciation

For each of the cars, I computed annual depreciation. To factor in LKR devaluation and inflation, I also calculated the equivalent dollar prices and depreciation.

### SUVs Only

Some of the results are not statistically significant, but I included them for comparison. They didn't seem substantially different from Non-SUV vehicles.

## Conclusion

This is a very rough analysis. But it seems that my friend was a bit too optimistic about our car market. On average, it appears that a car loses about 7% of its LKR value annually or about 13% of its USD value.

Now, does that make my Uber rider cheaper? Or should I buy a car? Let me ponder that question for a few days.
