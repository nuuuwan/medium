# Sri Lankan Beaches

### A Rough Guide

[I originally wrote this article in 2016, and shared it amongst friends on Facebook]

Friends have often asked me what the best beaches in Sri Lanka are. So, I'm writing this short note, with some quick thoughts on the topic. "Best" obviously depends on what you are looking for.

Sri Lanka is a small country, but there's a fair variation in the types of beaches and seaside experiences. I've taken a shot at roughly categorising some of my favourite beaches into 4 regional groups.

### Important Caveats

* I'm not a "travel-expert" so take this with a pinch of salt, but hopefully this will be useful

* The general "bar" on Sri Lankan beaches is quite high — you could pick one of the beaches below at random, and there's a good chance you'll like it.

* Sri Lanka is not a "beaches only" destination. Our history goes back well beyond 2500 years, there's a huge amount of bio-diversity, and breathtaking mountains and waterfalls. There's a lot to experience beyond beaches.

* My "regional groupings" don't include the North-West, North and North-East of the country. This is not because these regions don't have beautiful beaches, but because resort infrastructure is not as developed. This is likely to change in the future.

* The places mentioned below is not exhaustive, and is only a sample.

# Going Postal

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

Postal Voting for the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election commenced on October 31st. Various state employees including members of the armed forces and police are eligible to vote by post.

In 2015, postal votes made up about 4.3% of the valid votes polled. Of the 12,123,452 valid votes, 522,663 were voted-in by post. In 2019, 655,915 voters will be eligible to vote by post.

Postal votes are interesting because they are among the earliest results announced. Hence, many people try to gauge the direction and swing of an election based on postal ballots. But is this actually possible?

In this article, I try to answer: Can we use postal votes alone, to accurately predict the final result of an election?

## Brief History of Postal Votes

First, let's look at previous presidential elections, and how postal votes compared to the final result. For simplicity, I analyse the two main parties. Greens (UNP and NDF), and Blues (SLFP, PA, and UPFA).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*car_S2GcB4ZbxMXroJPN2A.png)

In all elections but 1988, the "winner" of the total postal votes, went on to win the election. In 1994, 1999 and 2005, the proportion of postal votes a party received was very close to the final result. 1999 was also unusual in that both main parties got relatively fewer postal votes, with the JVP candidate (Nandana Gunatilleke) receiving disproportionately more postal ballots.

In 1982, 2005 and 2010, the winning party received a disproportionately larger number of postal votes. The 2005 postal votes were particularly significant. Without these, the UPFA would not have reached the 50% limit needed to win a presidential election outright. A second/third preference count might have been necessary.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*t9PoVhL8_U9ohRvOInpwFg.png)

Across electoral districts, there is some variation in the proportion of postal votes relative to total votes. In 2015, the Colombo electoral district had the smallest portion of postal votes (1.9%), while Anuradhapura (8.2%) had the largest. This probably reflects the portion of the population employed by the state and armed forces.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HqIuQTyn6dqh_-rJRskprQ.png)

## Can we use postal votes to predict the final result of an election?

For 2005, 2010 and 2015, I built a regression model to predict the final vote proportion for Green and Blue, based on only the postal votes the parties received from the 22 electoral districts.

This chart represents the "Best Case Predictions" for Blues and the Greens. In all three elections, the regression predictions were wide enough for both parties to have some possibility of winning the election.

Even in 2010 (an extremely one-sided election), postal votes, alone, were not enough to predict a win for Blue.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1akWMihvu1O5zmPU7u3JZA.png)

I anticipated this "non-result" in Election Projections. In 2010, while the projection was able to call the final result of the election, this was only after about 30 results, and after all the postal votes were announced.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wtt09h2GA4pv2RalDe3qyQ.png)

## Conclusion

So, can we use postal votes alone, to accurately predict the final result of an election? The answer is, no.

While postal votes are quite interesting, and are strongly correlated with the final election result, alone, they are insufficient to predict the outcome of the election with statistical confidence.

Hence, as the results of November 16th are announced, and if you see your team "winning" the postal votes, don't get too excited. Things could change.

Happy Voting!

# The Most Important Job

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

Many who read my medium articles think I'm a Data Scientist specialising in Elections. That, I am not. I'm not even a Data Scientist. I run a tech consultancy, specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography. That is my "day" job.

These days, I spend a lot of time interviewing and recruiting. Software Engineers, and some related roles like Product Managers and Data Scientists. Hiring suitable people is complex and challenging. And involves an elaborate "recruitment process".

On November 16th, I'll be participating in another job interview. An interview for the most important job in Sri Lanka. CEO of Sri Lanka Inc. The 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election. So will many of you.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7HtpjOzf-ps0W3bPl0-mUg.png)

In this article, I compare and contrast the method I use for recruiting Software Engineers (aka SWEs), to the method we use for recruiting Presidents.

## Resumes

SWE resumes usually consist of Academic Record and Job Experience. Note, this is a "past" record. Few SWEs spend resume-space talking about the degrees or Nobel prizes, or the many CTO or engineering directorships they expect to get in the next five years. Or the next 100 days for that matter.

This "past" is easy to verify. If there is a ridiculous claim in a resume, a quick web search, or call will confirm or deny it.

On the other hand, "Resumes" for Presidential Candidates, almost wholly consist of the "future". "Manifestos" manifest with all manner of amazingness and goodies the candidates expect to do as soon as they are elected. Anything from 100 day plans to 5-year plans.

Why don't we scrutinise candidates' past more? You might argue that both Mr Premadasa and Mr Rajapaksa (to name just two) are "first-time" candidates. They don't have a "past record".

But of course they do have pasts. Very colorful ones too. And even if they don't have pasts, when we elect a President, we won't be choosing just one candidate. We elect a vast entourage of other politicians, lackeys, groupies and goons. They all have pasts.

## References

Most SWEs list a professor or a previous boss as a "reference", complete with contact details. These people are usually happy to provide information on the candidate. I myself have acted as "reference" to many former colleagues. Referees are typically selected to support the candidate. A SWE won't add a boss they hate as a referee.

Getting the Presidential Job is hard work. The campaign (probably) costs 100s of millions of rupees. And perhaps a few million dollars, dinars, and euros for good measure as well.

Like SWEs, Presidential candidates also have "professors" and bosses standing behind them. Happy to support them with rupees and dollars as required. At a modest interest rate, of course.

However, unlike SWEs, Presidential hopefuls tend not to mention these references. It would be nice to have a tabulated list of "references" complete with contact details and campaign contributions. But I'm yet to see any list. Probably the references are "very busy".

## Interviews

A SWE candidate could go through up to 10 hours of interviews. By several interviewers. Some over the phone. Some in person.

These interviews are dialogues. Where both interviewers and interviewees get to take questions and give answers.

So far, most of the "interviews" of presidential candidates I've seen are "monologues". They usually get on a stage and talk to a couple of thousand people. Sometimes more. These interviews are telecast over the media and are available on YouTube etc.

Why not move away from monologues to dialogues? Town-hall style? Where a bunch of voters can be picked at random, and spend a couple of hours with the candidate asking them questions? Media organisations could follow this style too.

## Diversity

About 30% of Sri Lankan computer science and engineering graduates are female (depending on how you count). However, only about 20% of junior SWEs are female, indicating that many female graduates opt for non-SWE jobs. The proportion drops to 10% with senior SWEs, and 5% with highly skilled SWEs, with post-graduate qualifications.

The problem is not with females, but with the industry itself. Various aspects of tech-company "Bro-Culture" from the office environment, to benefits, to work hours, are highly male-biased. Hence, tech has an enormous diversity problem and is effectively excluding 50+% of the population. Many of us are doing our best to fix the problem, but a lot remains to be done.

If you think 5% is wrong, then consider 2.8%. This is the portion of female candidates for the November 16th election. Namely, 1 out of 35. Sausage-Fest alert!

## Concluding Thoughts

If I reviewed our Presidential Candidates (SWE interview style), I'd make the following notes:

* Resume only talks about the future. Cannot be verified.

* References, omitted.

* Interviews, one-sided monologues.

* Diversity, none.

My conclusion would be: Insufficient information and diversity. Please fix recruiting process.

If you think I'm trivialising our democracy by comparing it to tech recruiting, could you explain to me what I'm missing? Why should a more critical job have a utterly trivial recruitment process?

If you tell me that you're not a company founder and don't need to bother about recruiting, you're wrong.

Every Sri Lankan citizen is a shareholder in Sri Lanka Inc. We are all part of the corporation's decisions. Including hiring the CEO. Which is what we'll be doing in two Saturdays.

Happy Recruiting!

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

# How to write a manifesto

### A Brit, an Armenian and a Kenyan walk into a polling booth...

Let's suppose you are a presidential election candidate. Suppose you are busy writing your manifesto. What should you put in it?

That depends. On many things. For one, who is going to read your manifesto?

A Brit, an Armenian, or a Kenyan?

## Britain, Armenia, and Kenya

Many factors divide Sri Lanka. Religion and Ethnicity are the usual suspects. But I'd argue that the biggest villains are economics in general, and economic inequality in particular.

One could argue that the real reason for the 30-year war, was not ethnic, but economic. Would the LTTE have taken arms if their economic lot was good? Economics was also undoubtedly at the root of the two leftist insurrections in 1971 and 1987.

The numbers are clear. The poorest 10% of Sri Lankans are responsible for only 2.9% of income or expenditure. While the wealthiest 10% are responsible for about 33.3%. The 80% in the middle, take the remaining 63.8%.

Extrapolating these numbers on Sri Lankan's GDP per capita of $13K (at purchasing power parity), the wealthiest 10% would have a GDP per capita of $45K (approximately equal to the United Kingdom). The middle 80% would have $11K (like Armenia). The bottom, $4K (like Kenya).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sKQmQ8XDXN41k0fjGGJbew.png)

Hence, you might say that Sri Lanka's divisions lie across Sinhala-Tamil-and Muslim. Or Buddhism-Hinduism-Islam-and Christianity. But they actually lie across Britain-Armenia-and Kenya.

Three very different Sri Lankas.

## What Sri Lankans want

I like to visualize Britain, Armenia, and Kenya relative to Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DSRLWyEMw0KF5ipLDBt6rw.png)

At the bottom, there are Physiological needs like Health, Food, and Shelter. Next, there are "Safety" needs like Personal, Emotional, and Financial safety. Next, there are social needs, self-esteem needs, self-actualization needs, and self -transcendence needs.

While this is a gross simplification (and un-researched), it seems that Kenyan Voters (relatively) care most about Physiological needs. Armenian Voters about Safety needs. And British Voters, the "higher" needs.

[Apologies again for the over-simplification. In the end, it's only a model. And all models are wrong. It is just that some models are useful. And I believe this model is.]

## What to put in your manifesto

Satisfying Kenyan Voters is uncontroversial. Historically, Sri Lanka has had a generous healthcare, and welfare system, and most presidential candidates would keep this intact. Ideally, improve it.

But beyond Kenya, things get complicated.

Armenians don't worry about Physiological needs "in the moment", but are worried about satisfying these in the future. Hence, they look for "security". Personal, Emotional, and most importantly, Financial security.

Brits, on the other hand, have got both Physiological and Safety needs covered, and aspire for higher things. In this election, as in previous elections, they yearn for words like "democracy", "good governance", the "rule of law" and "reform".

There is an obvious conflict between Britain and Armenia.

## Collision Course

Except for a few places (e.g. London, I mean, Colombo), the majority of Sri Lankans are citizens of Armenia. Hence, understandbaly, most politicians have courted the Armenian vote.

The primary strategy for satisfying Armenia's need for "safety" has been political patronage. Powerful politicians become ministers of this, that or the other ministry. These ministers have thousands of jobs in their gift. These jobs go to loyal Armenians.

The Brits have always looked down on this "disease" of patronage. Their cure usually focusses on the "supply-side". I.e. the side of the politician. Better democracy, transparency, and accountability combined with reform (like reducing the power of ministers), that downsize the "gift" that politicians own.

Unfortunately, this "supply-side" activism does not deal with the main problem. The "demand-side". You might clip the wings (or head) of a corrupt politician. But what do you tell the thousands of Armenians whose livelihoods are also in the balance?

## Killing the Goose

Any presidential candidate who wants to win both the British vote and the Armenian vote will have to find a way of convincing the Armenians to kill the goose that lays their golden eggs.

On the plus side, many factors would support a Goose Slaughter.

* Money. A shift away from patronage to "real jobs" would not need more money. We would move money away from, say, useless endeavours(e.g. worthless degrees) to supporting meaningful and useful ones (e.g. vocational training).

* Jobs. There is no shortage of jobs. Quite the opposite. Sri Lanka has a severe labour shortage. It's a matter of convincing people to move away from "safe" jobs to "real" jobs.

* Motivation. Among the majority of Armenians there is a strong motivation to get out of political patronage. But they can't break the vicious cycle.

On the minus side, there will probably be considerable short-term pain. Clearly for the ministerial goose.

For example, who will tell thousands of "Arts Graduates", that their philosophy degrees are useless? And that they will have to take jobs in "vocational" areas?

An obvious step down for "education"-worshipping Armenians.

## Concluding Confessions

This article is partly a letter to my "London-Liberal" friends. They are continually whinging about "supply-side" aspirations like "democracy", "good governance", and the "rule of law". They don't see Sri Lanka for what it is. They probably think everyone is like them. Or at least should be like them. A San Francisco-esque caricature of Sri Lanka. They should focus less on fancy words and more on killing geese.

This article is also partly a challenge to presidential candidates or aspiring presidential candidates. Do you have a plan that will keep Britain, Armenia and Kenya all happy?

>>> If a Brit, an Armenian and a Kenyan walk into a polling station, can you win all three votes?

# On First-Time Voters

### 2019 Sri Lanka Presidential Election

In Sri Lanka, the minimum voting age is 18. Since the last presidential election was in 2015, if you are a Sri Lankan citizen born in 1998, 1999, 2000 or 2001, the 2019 edition would likely be your first Sri Lankan Presidential Election.

How will First-Time Voters impact the 2019 election?

## Distribution of FTVs in 2019

[For this article, I define first-time voters (FTV), as voters who are voting for the first time in the Presidential Election. I.e. people who will be old enough to vote this November 16th, but were not old enough to vote in the 2015 Presidential Election. Even if you've already voted in another election, if this is your first presidential election, you are an FTV.]

Sri Lanka last conducted a census in 2012. Hence, I shift the age statistics to compute the number of FTVs. Also factoring in mortality (using Life-Tables) for various age-groups.

The proportions of FTVs by district are:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7g8qkIDSw2t6-AT3XbPglw.png)

The absolute number of FTVs are:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VWsDJfq1d3WUTEG6WUBo3g.png)

Many factors could contribute to these differences. Including:

* Life Expectancy. Areas with lower life expectancies would have a larger proportion of youth, and hence FTVs

* Birth Rate. Areas with higher birth-rates would have a larger percentage of FTVs.

* Migration

[I didn't have enodata to analyze these factors in detail]

## How FTVs Vote and Misleading Correlations

Presidential Elections are by secret ballot. Hence, we don't know how a particular age group might have voted.

On the other hand, we could investigate if polling divisions with high numbers of FTVs voted any differently.

In this graph, I analyze the 2015 Sri Lankan Presidential Election. In the X-axis, I plot the proportion of FTVs in a polling division. In the Y-axis, the difference in votes between the NDF and the UPFA.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0G7I4Wph9roQTb2CTPFzMg.png)

The fitted line has the equation:

(NDF Vote minus UPFA Vote) = 13.82 x (First-Time Votes) -107.53 %

If you read this blindly, you might conclude that for every 1% of additional FTVs, the NDF won an additional 13.82% votes. This is true, but not a useful observation. Let's see why.

### A Tale of Two Towns

Consider the following "toy" example.

There are two fictional polling divisions, "Rich-Town" and "Poor-Town" side by side. The voters of Rich-Town have excellent healthcare and nutrition and hence enjoy a high life expectancy. "Poor-Town" on the other hand, is not so lucky. Healthcare, nutrition and life-expectancy lag behind Rich-Town.

In 2015, Rich-Town had 1000 voters, of whom 100 were FTVs. Poor-Town also had 1000 voters. But with its lower life-expectancy, had a larger FTV population of 200.

Two parties, The Black Party and White Party, contested the 2015 presidential election. The Black Party has policies favouring wealthier voters and hence expected more votes in Rich Town. The White Party, on the other hand, supported poorer voters and expected more votes in Poor Town.

In Rich-Town, the Black Party won 600 votes to the White Party's 400 votes. We don't know how the 100 FTVs contributed to this, because of secret ballots. In Poor-Town, the White Party won 700 votes, to the White Party's 300.

In Rich-Town, the White minus Black Party Votes difference was -20%. While in Poor-Town it was +40%. We also know that Rich-Town had 10% FTVs while Poor-Town had 20% FTVs.

Now, could we conclude that for every 10% increase in the FTV proportion, the White Party's vote increases by 60%?

We can't. The reason is that in this toy example, the FTV proportion is not the "causal" factor which influences the final vote. It is merely "correlated". Both FTVs and non-FTVs in Rich-Town tend to support the Black Party, while both FTVs and non-FTVs in Poor-Town support the White Party. The "causal" factor is probably income or the parties' policies towards healthcare.

...

Sri Lanka is Rich-Town and Poor-Town. The "causal" factors have probably more to do with ethnicity, economics, and regional politics, than youth issues or FTVs.

This "confounding" we see in the national result does not go away, even when we look at smaller areas. For example, in the Southern Province, the pattern is even more exagerated.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oiiNHSdr5RKLbrjQ4fd_9w.png)

## So what can we say?

We don't have enough data to say how exactly FTVs will vote. However, if we assume that FTVs voting within a given polling division will be similar to non-FTV voting, we can estimate the effect the new voters will have on the final result.

In 2015, there were very distinct patterns in how various districts voted for various parties. In On Non-Voters, I introduced the concept of Deltas. A Delta is how much of a lead a party gets over the 50% limit needed to win an election. This is how Deltas distribute across the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*braxiVNB6gzz5aXOrc19vQ.png)

Similarly, we could compute Deltas for only first-time voters.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*q8RePSg1y2wjfDYyXyOV_A.png)

Overall, if FTVs vote in 2019 the same way non-FTVs do, and everyone votes in 2019 as they did in 2015, the NDF candidate would win about 20K incremental votes from FTVs.

## Concluding Thoughts

My main conclusion is that there is very little data to say anything quantitative about first-time voters.

Other factors like ethnicity confound trends, and we are forced to make hard assumptions like "FTVs will vote exactly like non-FTVs" and "2019 will be exactly like 2015".

Either way, while the impact of FTVs will (probably) not be significant for the election, the election should be significant for FTVs. It will be their first participation in our representative democracy. That itself should be significant.

Happy Voting!

# Predictions and #SkinInTheGame

### Betting on the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Elections

There are millions of reasons to despise astrologers. But my personal favourite is that they face no downside if they make bogus predictions. They say whatever nonsense comes to mind and leave the poor client to face the music. As far as the charlatan is concerned it is heads you lose, tails he wins.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oUVAPJ8HLmdGE6Ux134HAA.jpeg)

As Nasim Taleb would have put it, astrologers have absolutely no #SkinInTheGame.

Many astrologers have made predictions about the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Elections. And so have many Data Scientists: professional and amateur (like yours truly).

Unfortunately, too many Data Scientists have been making predictions based on suspect methodologies. But since they too, like astrologers, have no #SkinInTheGame, they have no incentive to do otherwise.

In this article, I describe a simple strategy to add #SkinInTheGame to predictions: All predictions must be accompanied by betting odds. You can't predict, if you also don't let everyone else (or at least your friends) bet on your odds.

## How to define odds

Recently, an astrologer turned data scientists (or data scientist turned astrologer — it is hard to tell the difference sometimes), sent me a lengthy analysis which concluded that Mr Rajapaksa would get 55% of the national vote, and Mr Premadasa 45%.

The "analysis" was utter garbage, but I thought I'd use it as an illustrative example.

Given the 55% probability for Purple, the odds in favour of Blue is 55/45, or 11/9. The odds are the "probability of winning" divided by the "probability of loosing". If Blue wins, and you bet Rs. 55, you win an additional Rs. 45.

Similarly, your odds for Green would be 45/55, or 9/11. If Green wins and you bet Rs.45, you win an additional Rs.55.

Punters would note that I make two assumptions:

* That the market is rational and efficient. I.e. that the market's notion of probability would be identical to the bookmakers.

* The bookmaker is "not-for-profit", and keeps no margin on bets. In the real world, bookmakers would have anything from a 5% to 50% margin on bets.

This is correct.

## So Nuwan, what odds are you giving?

The closest I came to giving probabilities for candidates was in A Machine's Opinion.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y1DesBsC1XKpaZvUL_z4mw.png)

Green would probably get between 38.4% and 51.2% of the vote, and the Blues between 46.4% and 59.1%.

This is a bit different from the previous example because this is not single probabilities, but "Error Bounds" of probabilities. How might we translate these numbers into betting odds?

In each scenario, we would have to assume the worst case from the bookmaker's point-of-view. And as a result, define odds based on the best case probability for each candidate.

So, we would assume that Green had a 51.2% chance of winning, and Blue had a 59.1% chance of winning. Rounding up for good measure, the odds would be something like 14/13 for Green and 3/2 for Blue.

## But isn't this Illegal?

To be clear, I won't be making any "books" for the next election. And to be even clearer, 59.1% and 51.2% were not my opinions. Readers of A Machine's Opinion would know that it was my laptop's opinion. So if you have any questions on betting, talk to the machine, ‘cos the Human ‘ain't listening.

On the other hand, if you are a proper Data Scientist and you've offered odds, you have a "get out of jail free card": Error Bounds. Given the complexity and uncertainty around the election, any legitimate prediction should have huge Error Bounds. I'd say even broader than the 38.4% to 51.2% that I (ahem, I mean my laptop) came up with.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IzmAOcujIfdaQUwSs5-76A.jpeg)

The good thing about error bars is that it will result in you (the bookmaker) making such huge profits that the bet will look nothing like a bet, and more like a donation. And as far as I know, there is no law against charitable donations to deserving Data Scientists.

The bad thing is, with such odds, no one in their right mind will bet.

The astrologers and bad Data Scientist, who don't understand error bounds, have no "get out of jail free card". Not only are they likely to lose money on bets, but the authorities are also likely to charge them with criminal behaviour. And about time.

Happy Punting!

# On Code Quality

### Debunking 3 Myths

Zillions of lines of code form the core of everything technological. From web-services like Google. To the controller on your fridge. To the auto-pilot that navigates an Airbus A380. A vast interconnected graph of "programmes". Calling each other, and doing all manner of miracles.

Computer scientists differentiate "What the code should do" from "How well the code should do that".

For example, "what the code should do" could be returning a bunch of search results after the user types "define: code quality".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3OyyXShMozHKQVhSz4r-Yg.png)

"How well the code do that" could include "the speed of returning search results".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aXcCR0CzkvqmvwFleCwCxA.png)

These two aspects are known as "functional" and "non-functional" requirements. The quality of software (or "software quality") is also split into these two groups: "functional" and "non-functional".

The terms "software quality" and "code quality" are often interchangeable. Though usually "software quality" is a "macro" description — referring to the entire system or product. While "code quality" is a "micro" description, referring to individual bits of code.

While code quality is an important topic, many myths surround it.

## Myth 1: Code Quality has an absolute bar

It's easy to define an absolute bar for code quality. It's much harder to find the correct bar.

Writing high-quality code has benefits. A better customer experience. A better quality system or product. Fewer bugs.

Unfortunately, it also has costs. It requires better computer scientists. More tests. More testing infrastructure. And longer development cycles.

How you tradeoff cost and benefits depends on the nature of your product, system, and ultimately business. For example, if your product is free (e.g. Facebook), your users (probably) can tolerate a lot more bugs than an enterprise product (e.g. Facebook AdsManager). If your product is a even higher precision — higher safety system (e.g. a Flight control system), your tolerance for bugs is even lower.

Hence, you need to adapt your philosophy towards code quality based on what you are coding. There is no point in having Flight control system code quality on Facebook or vice versa.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XUVoJg6Elhg_NsF7e0tOPQ.png)

## Myth 2: The Best Code has Zero Bugs

It is relatively easy to reduce bugs. More testing, more detailed code reviews, and more QA people will usually reduce the number of bugs. The problem is that all these things cost money.

A good coder can reduce bugs. A great coder can move the bug-cost curve.

Great Coders figure out ways to have fewer bugs at the same cost. Or the same number of bugs at a lower cost.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5yZgquVBKBTMbsCUl-qYTQ.png)

## Myth 3: Improving Code Quality is solely about Improving Code

A good coder does zoology. A great coder does ecology.

Let me explain the biological analogy.

A good coder tries to improve code quality by improving coding and the code. This is like zoology because code is like an organism. And zoology studies organisms.

A great coder, on the other hand, tries to improve the whole ecosystem. Multiple organisms include many coders and many lines of code. They build better testing frameworks. They institute better code review processes. They create code quality tools.

# On the Rule of Law

### Killing a Straw Man

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ooKfc4r26jydtMVmjVSh6w.jpeg)

## Chess

All games have rules. Like chess. Without rules, the two players wouldn't know what to do. If one player thought a bishop moved like a rook, and the other thought like a knight, the game wouldn't last long.

Rules make it possible to program computers to play chess. Not only can we program computers to play chess, but we can also program them to play chess with themselves. And as a result, simulate billions of new games. This type of "Artificial Intelligence" has led to chess computers that can beat grandmasters.

The strategy has even worked for more complicated games. Like Go.

But there are even more complicated games. Like life itself. The "Rule of Law" applies to individuals who live in collectives like societies. To live in society, you have to obey the rules.

## Life

In all games, there is some incentive to obey the rules. If you cheat at chess, no one will play with you again. You might even acquire a "reputation", and even people who have not played you in the past will avoid playing you. You might earn the monicker #CrookedNuwan.

Similarly, in life, the rule of law can only work if there are incentives to obey the law. If there are no incentives, there will be no laws.

Sometimes laws are unfair. France was a very unfair place in the 18th century. A small minority lived in idle luxury, at the expense of a majority that worked and starved. The laws made sure that the taxes from the majority supported the minority. Disobeying laws led to horrible punishments. But the starving majority didn't really care, because these horrible punishments weren't very different from the lives they already led. And so, they revolted.

While the situation in Sri Lanka is not as bad as revolutionary France, the incentive to obey the rule of law varies widely from citizen to citizen. The "British" (as I analogize in How to write a manifesto), have a much stronger incentive to the insecure "Armenians" or the impoverished "Kenyans". Just as the majority believed in revolutionary France, many "Armenians" and "Kenyans" believe that the "Rule of Law" in Sri Lanka is solely for the benefit of Rich Brits.

There are also other ways in which the Rule of Law breaks down. In Ancien Régime France, while murder was punishable by death in theory, it only applied to "common people" in practice. Hence, a prince could easily get away with murdering his man-servant. This was because a small group of people had so much power that the law could not be applied to them in practice.

There are many examples of this power-play in Sri Lanka. Many influential politicians intimidate the police who attempt to prosecute them for various misdeeds. This is not a problem with the politicians or the police. It is a problem with a power-ecosystem that supports extreme power. This is also why there is no such thing as a "benevolent dictator". Absolute power will, eventually, corrupt absolutely.

## If you want the Rule of Law

Too many people who promote or yearn for the Rule of Law, don't completely understand it. If they did, they would not ask for it.

If you want the Rule of Law, don't ask for the Rule of Law. Instead, ask for conditions out of which the Rule of Law will emerge. Naturally, slowly perhaps, but with certainty. Ask for conditions like less poverty. And less extreme power.

If you want the Rule of Law, but continue asking for it, you won't get it. All you'll get is gibberings and tauntings. And the rotting smell of a putrifying straw man.

# On Guilt

### A unilateral decision

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z9R1SmMYIgKRg54GNXz3Wg.png)

Guilt is feeling bad about committing something bad in the past. Many philosophies describe guilt as a good thing, that motivates one to be good. On the one hand, there is some truth to this. If we feel bad after doing bad things, that is clearly a disincentive. On the other hand, guilt has its bad side too.

### Problems of Guilt

One problem I have with guilt is that it is almost infinite. If I were to enumerate all the bad things I've done, I wouldn't know where to stop. Or even where to start for that matter.

Another problem. For every guilty secret I can remember, there are ten which I can't remember, or misremember. And people always seem to have double standards about guilt. For example, if you are German or Japanese, it is fine to feel guilty about all the naughty things your grand-parents or great-grand-parents did during WWII. On the other hand, if you bombed Dresden, or Hiroshima, or Nagasaki, you're not allowed to be guilty. You have to be content with pride or happiness. But not guilt. With wars at least, the losing side seems to have some monopoly over guilt.

But my chief beef with guilt is that it a vicious cycle. It is a monster that feeds on itself and grows. Because once you feel guilty, you can be guilty about being guilty. And guilty about being guilty about being guilty.

### A unilateral decision

So I've taken a unilateral decision. I've decided to abolish guilt. At least the portion of guilt that exists within my personal jurisdiction:

>>> If you are feeling guilty about anything you have thought about, said or done to me, you are completely and unconditionally forgiven. You can stop feeling guilty.*

[* The fine print is: there is no fine print. I said unconditionally.]

# On Mountains, Rivers, and Waterfalls

### Notes of a Novice Meditator

## Mountains

There are many handbooks and treatises on how to meditate on one's breath (a.k.a. Anapanasati). Many recommend mastering the practice in stages.

A handbook that I follow recommends the following via negativa:

* Exclude thoughts of past and future

* Exclude inner commentary

* Exclude all attention but that on breathing

At first, I thought that stages were hurdles to conquer. Like climbing a mountain. You first conquer the lower part of the mountain. And then you climb the middle section. And so on. You can't get to a stage without completing the previous stage.

At first glance, this felt true. But for some reason, the analogy of the mountain felt misleading. I contemplated why.

And then I realised that the reality was less like a mountain, and more like a river. It was less like climbing up, and more like flowing down.

## Rivers

You didn't really have to "conquer" one stage and then conquer the next stage. You just needed to "be in" one stage, and the next stage seemed to flow naturally and seamlessly. Like flowing down a river.

And sometimes there were even waterfalls. Sudden bursts of progress. Usually, when you least expected. You were enjoying yourself on a calm river, and then suddenly a waterfall.

Let me explain.

Thoughts of past, future and present are like naughty children in a classroom. Mindfulness is the teacher. The fewer the naughty children, the easier for the teacher to manage the class. With past and future safely marched off to the principal's office, the present is far more likely to behave.

Similarly, almost all of our conscious thoughts refer to memories. When we think "that is a horn of a bus" we are connecting with many memories of horns, busses and other things. These memory associations are with past or future. If the past and future are banished, there is little need for commentary.

And hence with excluding thoughts of past and future, we gently flow down the waterfall leading to excluding inner thoughts.

## The Second Waterfall

What does a mind with no past, future, or thought feel like? And how would it be aware of breathing?

When we visit a doctor with a chest complaint, and she holds a stethoscope to our chest and says "breathe", we breathe. We brace ourselves, take in a deep gulp of air, and breathe out dramatically. Usually with sound-effects to match.

This "breathing" is very different from the "breathing" that happens in breadth meditation. In the former, we anticipate the big breath. In the future. We also picture breathing and visits to the doctor in the past. Hence, past and future are not banished. We also "think". Thus, there is inner commentary too.

So, how, then, would a mind with no past, future, or thought be aware of breathing?

For a start, there can be no association with a memory of past breathing or breath. Nor anticipation of future thought. All there can be is a subtle awareness of the present state of the breathing process. A state that has no name. Only a state. And one that is momentary.

And why is such an awareness inevitable as falling down another waterfall on a river?

For a mind with no future, past or thought, there is very little going on. But one thing we can't get away from is breathing, for without breath we die. And so, the mind naturally catches on to breath. And since it is aware of the breathing that is "now", it cannot be aware of anything else. Hence, it excludes all else.

And down another waterfall.

## The journey to the sea

And what happens next? Do we exclude breathing? And suffocate?

If you're interested in the rest of the journey, I'd recommend that you try some meditation experiments yourself. As I said, there are many useful handbooks. I use Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond: A Meditator's Handbook by Ajahn Brahm, myself.

Happy Travels!

# Third Candidate, Second Preference, First Job

### The Dilemma of the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

For the first time in 20 years, the JVP is fielding a presidential candidate. While few expect Anura Kumara Dissanayaka (AKD) to win outright, many expect him to influence the final result. Possibly, by "splitting the vote".

How might a "third candidate" change the result?

I try to answer this question by analysing a few hypothetical scenarios.

## Hypothetical Scenario I (No Third Candidate)

Let's suppose that no third candidate ran. If the outcome in 2019 is the same as in 2015, the final result would be:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7MyTeoULhQ4KGadlzUGOBw.png)

[I've excluded the "other" candidate votes. Hence, the total valid votes is less than that of 2019.]

"Non-Hypotethical" Note: For 2019 to be like 2015, SP would have to win a significant proportion of the "Floating Vote". This will be quite difficult.

## Hypothetical Scenario II (Third Candidate, and Diligent Second Preference Voting)

Now, let's suppose AKD did run. And let us also suppose he won all 17% of the Floating Vote (of which we assumed that SP would win 13% and GR 4% in Scenario I). The final result would be:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*41mK7WQNZsrx9CRSGc6CVA.png)

The instant-runoff would come into play. AKD is eliminated, and his second preference votes are counted. If all AKD's supporters cast their second preference votes for the candidate they would have voted for had AKD not run, then the second preferences for SP and GR would have been as follows:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B_NV1naaSXMp-BcAxgHbQQ.png)

The final result would be the same as Scenario I.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0AYZMfMxQmUcDDPGTQn5aQ.png)

Hence, if all AKD's voters use their second preference, his candidature would not change the final result of the election.

The "instant-runoff" system is designed for precisely this scenario. It tries to make sure that the result of a three-horse-race is precisely that of a two-horse race. However, it also assumes that voter "participate" in the system. I.e. they cast their second preferences. This might not be the case.

"Instant-runoff" also makes a second assumption. That voters will accurately state their second preference. What I mean by "accurate" is that the voter's second preference is actually who they would have voted for, if their first preference didn't exist. This assumption might also not hold.

## Hypothetical Scenario III (Third Candidate, and 20% Second Preference Voting)

Second preferences have never been counted in a past election. It is unclear if all voters understand their significance, and understand how to exercise them.

Hence, if (say) only 20% of AKD's voters use their second preference, the final result would be:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pC4V0TxRaPIDE7VWap3Tqg.png)

## Hypothetical Scenario IV (Third Candidate, and 70% Second Preference Voting)

On the other hand, if 70% of AKD's voters use their second preference, we get:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fJ91G-8qtYqjs2YHaNWRJg.png)

Hence, the more diligently voters use their second preference, the smaller the effect of the third candidate.

## So what should you do?

Suppose your top preference for the "first job" is a third candidate (e.g. AKD). But you're sure that that candidate can't win. And you don't want a particular "non-third candidate" (GR or SP) to win. What do you do?

* Option 1: Do you vote for the other "non-third candidate" (SP or GR)?

* Option 2: Or do you vote for your first preference third candidate (AKD), and put your second preference for the other "non-third candidate" (SP or GR)?

On the one hand, you have a strong desire to break away from binary politics and prove that a "third-way" is possible. In which case, you take Option 2.

On the other hand, you want to "be safe". What if other voters don't exercise their second preference? You "default" to Option 1.

Clearly a dilemma.

Happy Voting!

# On Evolution

### And the Fundamental Fallacy of Fitness

Many equate "Evolution" with "The Survival of the Fittest". A process where fit entities survive and unfit ones die out. While "Evolution" often refers to "Biological Evolution", the principle can be applied to many other systems from markets to organisations.

Evolution works as follows:

* Entities exist in an ecosystem, competing for resources.

* The entities that are more suited to the ecosystem ("fit" entities) compete and utilise resources more efficiently.

* These fit entities, hence, have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing.

The definition of "fit" is "more suited to the ecosystem". If the ecosystem changes, the definition of "fit" also changes. Hence, "fit" is an emergent property of the ecosystem.

A corollary of things "emergent" nature is that there is no preconceived definition of "fit". It is whatever the ecosystem deems fit.

Unfortunately, too many people fallaciously believe that there is some absolute type of "fit". For example, "tall people" or "stronger people" are fitter in some way.

The Homo sapiens who roamed the African Savanah were quite tall — over 6 feet on average. Height was an advantage on the vast planes, to look out for prey or predators. But Homo sapiens weren't the only humans on earth. The Indonesian Island of Flores was home to Homo floresiensis. The island lacked resources, and so unnecessarily tall or big humans died of starvation. Those that survived were a race of dwarfs, not much more than 3 feet tall.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*b3a7aA9EZJ4QcE2EiNBidw.jpeg)

Hence, while on the African Savanah "tall" was "fit", on Flores "fit" was "short".

Within and without biology, taking "fit" for something that is "absolute" leads to all sorts of wrong conclusions. The syntactic form of the fallacy is:

>>> "In Y-like ecosystems, X is a fit property. Therefore, X is a fit property for all ecosystems".

Often, the "In Y-like ecosystems" is forgotten.

For example,

>>> "On the African Savanah, tall is good. Therefore, tall is good everywhere."

Or

>>> "Tall is good. Therefore, tall is good everywhere."

Here are a few other fallacies:

* In developed countries, democracy is good. Therefore, democracy is good everywhere.

* When religions are mutually tolerant, freedom of religion is good. Therefore, freedom of religion is always good."

* In his first term, he was a good president. Therefore, in his second term, he will be a good president."

In other words, the fittness falacy is a special case of "politicians logic":

>>> All cats have four legs. My dog has four legs. Therefore, my dog is a cat.

# The Disinformation Cycle

### And breaking it

## The vicious cycle

Democracy assumes the "wisdom of crowds". Or that the combined knowledge of a collective is superior to any individual. This wisdom assumes that the crowd is "informed". At least, to some minimal bar. The bar need not be too high. Because collective wisdom corrects individual deficiencies. In other words, the signal cleans-up the noise.

In theory, at least.

In practice, it an increasing number of voters are succumbing to disinformation. These misinformed voters are electing representatives based on disinformation. These elected representatives influence power structures that in turn, contribute more disinformation. And hence, a disinformation cycle emerges.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wtdYRmGvACXCUMsvBBnQwg.png)

## Information, information, information

But what is it that "flows" through this vicious cycle? What is it that flows from voter to representative? Representative to power structure? Power structure to information? And back to the voter?

The answer: information.

Elections, where voters elect representatives, are information gathering processes. Each voter fills-in a form indicating their representative preference. When representatives' decisions influence power, those decisions are information. For example, deciding who gets to have TV broadcast licences.

Similarly, the powers that be, political, economic and social, decide what new information adds to the pool, and what subtracts. And finally, some subset of this information flows back to the voter.

## Strategies for breaking the cycle

It is difficult to pinpoint why the cycle got started. For example, was it because too many voters were uneducated? Or was it because a few bad-apple politicians got elected? Or because a few plutocrats changed how power structures influenced media? And for the worse? Or did information itself change? Say from books to social media?

The answer is probably a bit of all these things. Either way, we need to break the cycle. Ideally, in several places.

Irrespective of which place you try to break, there are some basic "breaking" strategies. Some better than others.

### Reduction

Regulating mediums of information (from Facebook to TV channels to newspapers) is a common tactic. Often by defining specific types of information as "inappropriate" or "against policy".

Though far more controversial, restrictions could also be applied to the next stage. For example, what if certain "misinformed" voters are not allowed to vote?

Much of "constitutional reform" consists of clipping the wings of representatives. Giving them less power so that they influence power structures less. The most talked-about "reform idea" in Sri Lanka is probably "abolishing the executive presidency".

The process by which power structures influences information is, on the one hand, simple. For example, consider a society where only a minority is educated, and the majority is illiterate. The minority would create books, ideas, science, and philosophy.

On the other hand, this process is complicated, because even across members of a minority, views and ideas could differ. For example, in medieval Europe, only a minority was educated. But those of that minority who had opinions that contradicted the church were censored or worse.

Either way, powers can be restricted from producing information. And have been, historically.

### Backlash

A backlash might seem like reduction, but it is subtly different.

Any deficiency or perceived injustice can be combatted with the opposite injustice. For example, if it is perceived that voters get too much of one type of misinformation, this can be countered by a different kind of misinformation. Just as the Alt-Left is combatting the misinformation of the Alt-Right.

Similarly, if the democratic rights of one group are perceived to be infringed, the rights of some opposing group could be breached in return. Similar tit-for-tat tactics happen in how representatives influence power structures, and how these power structures affect information.

### Expansion

Presently there is some tension between regulation and libertarian-esque "freedom". Especially around information on the internet. Should there be absolute freedom of expression, or should there be restrictions? Many argue that this expansion of information is preferable to reduction.

At its birth, democracy too was restricted. To a few people, usually male, old and rich. Since then it has expanded to near universality. But even today, there is an opportunity for further expansion. Particularly, given that not all people and communities participate in democracy equally.

Expansion in how representatives influence power structures, is less about quantity and more about diversity. "Checks and balances" across different branches of government operate on this principle. For example, while the executive has considerable power, a legislature or a judiciary has the power that could check those powers.

Finally, just as powers might be censored, as the church did in mediaeval Europe, powers can be encouraged to be more diverse. Advances in Science, Arts and Culture contribute to this diversity. As do improvements to living conditions and aspirations.

### Expansion — In Practice

On the surface, "Expansion" might be the prefered "breaking" strategy. The reasons might seem obvious. After all, what's wrong with "Freedom of Speech", "Democracy", "Checks and Balances" and "Diversity of Creativity"?

In theory, there is nothing wrong with all of these things. In fact, they are ideal. However, in practice, they face considerable obstacles.

Many social media organizations have argued for "Freedom of Speech". But many views are "gagged" on social media, because the nature of feed ranking, advertising and virality significantly bias towards some opinions as opposed to others. Feed Ranking might optimize Ad Revenue, but not Enlightened Discourse.

There are similar inequalities in democracy. In practice, a rich man has "more votes" than a poor man, because the former can bribe politicians with millions in political contributions. The starving man or the sick man, who can't afford to trudge to the polling booth has no vote at all.

Similarly, while all MPs might look equal on paper, with the same mandate, a few are considerably more equal than others.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, restrictions on thought and ideas put considerable breaks on creativity. And ultimately progress. There is an apt saying that "science progresses whenever a Nobel laureate dies". Some of the most anti-education is from educationalists. And others who promote a status-quo as opposed to freedom of thought.

### Equity

There is a solution to all these problems of "expansion": Equity.

The most significant improvement to the internet is killing Revenue driven "feed ranking". In one stroke, this removes all the political, demographic, and ideological biases rampant in social media. A simple alternative is a random display or ranking by time. Why should a companies revenue determine what an utterly unrelated individual thinks?

The most significant improvement to democracy is to restrict inequalities of influence. Political contributions are probably at the top of the list.

Just as a few voters shouldn't have undue political influence, no politician should have extreme power. Governments should be split into as many branches with robust checks and balances. Extreme positions like executive presidencies and executive prime-ministerships should be abolished.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the stranglehold that a few institutions have on culture and creativity should go.

## What to do?

Thus, I believe that equity will begin to break down the vicious Disinformation Cycle.

"But who is going to start the ball rolling?", you ask.

I can start. So can you. How? Here are a few practical ideas.

* Move away from biased information sources

* Exercise your democratic rights. Help the "have-nots" acquire these rights. Expose and destroy the extreme rights of the "have-yachts".

* Vote for checks and balances, and weakening political power.

* Champion diversity of thought and creativity

# Your pain is mine pain

### Why no one is guilty

Imagine a situation where you feel someone deserves punishment for some crime. The extent of the sentence is not particularly important. It could be anything from a death penalty to an extended-term in jail, to a literal or figurative wrap on the knuckles.

Think of some scenario where a "guilty" party suffers pain, and you are happy that they suffer that pain.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AT0CZjVrxfsaWFCK8YSYNA.jpeg)

Whenever I feel such happiness, pain quickly follows that happiness. While the sense of gleeful justice still lingers, it is gradually replaced by a feeling of painful sympathy for the "victim". Or the "guilty" who, as a result of punishment, has become "victim".

Why do I feel sympathy? And why does the victim's pain lead me to forget justice?

The reason is apparent when you contemplate the nature of justice.

Justice is a set of rules and conventions. Necessary for a nation, society or organisation to endure. Without inventions like the "rule of law", collectives of individuals fall apart into disorder and anarchy. It is so essential that the individuals of the collective consider it not merely a convention, but internalise it as a natural law, religion or universal truth.

But there is nothing absolute or true about justice. It is merely a tool for stability and order. It is not "real".

Pain, on the other hand, is very "real". And hence, when I started feeling sympathy for the "guilty" who turned "victim", it was a case of the world returning to its "real" nature. Where the real replaced the unreal.

No one is guilty in a real sense. But everyone feels pain. Pain is so real, that when someone else is in pain, it will only be a matter of time before that pain becomes your pain.

At first, I wanted to subtitle this article with "Why everyone is innocent". And then I realised that just as "guilty" is an artefact of justice so is "innocent". And like justice, they are also imaginary.

But pain is real. The pain of the guilty is the pain of the innocent. And your pain is my pain.

# How far away is Kandy?

### A brief history of Sri Lankan highways

If I ask you, "How far away is Kandy"? How will you answer? "About 100kms"? Or "Could be 5 hours or more. Depending on traffic"?

Someone once told me,

>>> "The mission of a transport system is to shrink time. The more a transport system shrinks more time for more people, the better it is".

While this might sound science-fictionesque, it is very true. The slower a journey takes, the further away from the destination.

In this article, I not only attempt to answer the question "How far away is Kandy?", but also analyse how the answer has evolved with the evolution of our highway system.

## The Space Age

Our first A-class highway, the A1 highway from Colombo to Kandy, was constructed in 1820. In those early days, vehicles were few and far between, and, in comparison, road-space was relatively abundant.

The network grew organically to cover most of the country. Today, we have nearly 4,000kms of A-grade highways, and many more miles of AB, AC and B grade highways as well. Throughout most of this growth, road-space tended to grow faster than the number of vehicles, and hence, our roads continued to be space abundant.

In the '80s and '90 with a more liberal economy and faster development, the number of vehicles began to increase. However, this increase was not significant enough to tax the road network.

In this space, abundant age, "traffic" was rare, and there was not a significant difference between the best and worse case travel times for any particular route. The drive to Kandy from Colombo Fort usually lasted about 2.5 hours.

## The Traffic Age

The Space Age began to fall apart in the 2000s, and drastically in the 2010s. A combination of cheaper cars, more disposable income, and incentives like vehicle permits resulted in an exponential rise in the number of vehicles. The ratio of road space to vehicles plummeted.

The driving time to Kandy from Colombo Fort doubled to over 5 hours in high traffic. The driving time to Galle to nearly 4 hours. Within a few years, the shape of the country changed from one determined by space, to one defined by time.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_F6nkKy1SPNUFV0OvV-Rug.png)

## The Express Age

The E01 or Southern Expressway was opened in 2011. Sri Lanka's first-ever E-class highway. Journey time to Galle and many parts of the Southern Province was reduced significantly.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zgnpPkt5mqet9k7UJJKNCA.png)

The E04 or Central Expressway from Kadawatha to Katugastota via Kurunegala is also under construction. When complete, the journey time from Colombo Fort to Kandy should be about 3 hours at worst.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fh7zRMkkuuv2TucRjZkIhg.png)

## The Metro Age

Currently, travel time to Galle from Colombo Fort is a little over 2 hours. Nearly half that consists of reaching the E01, either at Kottawa or Hokandara. Similarly, travel from Colombo Fort to Kadawatha (entrance to the E04), could last an hour. These within-Colombo-travle times are likely to increase.

Given the density of population and buildings, it is not feasible for an Expressway to reach Colombo Fort. Hence, reducing travel time further (or preventing it from increasing) cannot be solely accomplished with Expressways. A different solution is needed.

More developed cities solve this problem with a metro system. Everything from underground systems to mono-rails. If Colombo has a metro system with an average speed of 45km/h, travel time to Kottawa or Kadawatha would be halved.

In this map, I simulate the effect of having a metro parallel to the A1, A2, A3 and A4 highways, within greater Colombo.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kTC1KYQe_QB-OiZYveypHw.png)

## The High-Speed Age

Expressways enable fast travel through areas of low population density. Metros do the same for high population density areas. Once these goals have been accomplished, the next logical step in time, shrinking is High-Speed Trains.

The speed limit for most motor vehicles is about 100km/h. But it is quite normal for trains to travel at 250km/h or more.

For example, if we have a 250km/h train from Colombo Fort to Kandy, travel time to Kandy would be less than 30min. Similar to Nawala.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kdPZVvo3k5fF3kNZX6vwWw.png)

## Can we do it?

Sri Lanka's highway system has made great strides since the A1 was opened. And we are well on our way in the Express Age. But can we make it to the Metro Age and the High-Speed Age?

"The mission of a transport system is to shrink time. The more a transport system shrinks more time for more people, the better it is", was told to me by a non-executive director of the UK's national rail. Oddly, this was not at a seminar or conference. It was on a second class train compartment from London Kings Cross to Cambridge.

The Metro Age and the High-Speed Age will have significant technology and economic challenges. But the most critical challenge would be one of people. Do we have the people, and more importantly leaders who can make this happen?

People who are proud to travel second class, and talk about the future with hope and sincerity?

# Censoring news media

### A demand-side point-of-view

I'm no fan of censorship. Of any kind. I'm even against censoring lies from people who do bad things.

Not because I agree with these lies. But because censorship is messy and inefficient at best. And usually, censorship is less about protection from lies, and more about suppressing people. Often the opponents of governments and other powerful entities.

Even when what is censored is actual lies, the process is rarely beneficial. When lies are censored, liers gain legitimacy and importance. "The big, bad state censored me. So I must be right" etc. etc.

On the other hand, too much media is misleading people. And the growth of the internet and social media have given liars and misinformers unprecedented reach and audience. Too many people are making too many vital decisions based on too many lies. Like voting in democratic elections.

But what to do?

## Supply and Demand

There are two sides to any news. #FakeNews or otherwise. There is supply. Journalists, media organisations and ordinary people who supply news. And demand. The people (like you and I) who consume the said news.

Traditional censorship works by governments and other regulators pontification on what the supply side is allowed to do. Or more often, not allowed to do. For example, our government could say "No one is allowed to publish any news about the 30-year civil war in Sri Lanka". And if such a law is enforced, no Sri Lankan medium will be able to publish news on the topic.

But there is another way to do censorship. On the demand side. Whatever media choose to say, the people who consume can choose not to consume some mediums and channels.

## Buffoons, Blabbering and Balls

I don't have a TV at home. That's just one method I use for "demand-side" censorship. I don't want to fill my living room with a bunch of buffoons blabbering utter balls. And I enjoy the resulting peace and quiet.

While I don't watch TV, I do read newspapers, both hard copies and on the internet. I read blogs and subscribe to magazines. And there is plenty of misinformation and disinformation in these media. Even "reputable" mediums have bias. And that's quite natural. All humans and human organisations are biased to some extent.

But while bias is not new, two other phenomena are new.

* Humans a paralysed by the sheer volume of information. Under these circumstances, it is easy to be shallow and uncritical.

* Technology has primarily supported misinformation and its dissemination. The combination of mental paralysis and powerful technology leads to further paralysis and more technology. A vicious cycle ensues.

Hence, humans have become slaves to technology. How might we put technology back in its proper place? Make it our slave again?

## Intelligent Demand-Side Censorship

Too many people have resigned to the paralysis of social media, information overload. Like a drug that starts as an innocent recreation, then becomes a chronic addiction, and finally a complete master. And too few people believe that the tide can be turned.

But there is hope. Because most of the unbelievers also believe that the only way to solve the problem is through supply-side regulation.

I'm not asking you to, like me, stop watching TV. That instrument is far too blunt. But there are far more intelligent and nuanced ways in which we might control our media exposure. And technology might be a helpful slave, as opposed to being a despotic master.

Enter Tom.

## Tom Hayden

Imagine you had a trusted friend who always accompanied you while you consumed media. A sort of Tom Hayden-eque Consigliere*, who nudges you when something is wrong.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sWitOi8GwQ-8Ap4TZV9iCA.png)

For example, suppose you read the following on social media:

>>> "Reporter X says that Politician Y said that the GDP of Sri Lanka is Z"

Tom Hayden would point out, quoting Wikipedia, which in turn references the IMF, that Sri Lankan's GDP is actually W, not Z.

Tom would also point out that Politician Y is famous for lying, and, in fact, 47.34% of everything she says is a lie. More importantly, she would point out that Politician Y is expected to get a 67% kick-back from a development loan.

And not just about Politician Y. Tom would point out that, while Reporter X doesn't actually tell lies, he doesn't say anything of use either. 70% of what he says are quotes of famous people like Politician Y. And he never checks if these quotes are accurate.

But Tom would be no mere fact-checker. He would give far more thoughtful and useful advice.

For example, he might criticise you for only reading a small set of media that you like. Like newspaper A and blog B. He might point out that newspaper C has a much more diverse viewpoint.

You might even ask Tom to keep track of the variety and diversity of your media diet. Like you might ask a good (food) nutritionist, to track what you eat.

## What next?

I am a computer scientist. And we computer scientists build stuff. We have built many bad stuff in the past, but we have also built good stuff. We are also capable of building good stuff that will turn bad stuff into better stuff.

This article is an early-stage "product specification" in disguise. I want to build a "Tom Hayden". Currently, I'm trying to understand what "features" Tom should have.

# How to read a book

### Brain Hacking

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n6rjTaBRacGFvFO_Il0y4g.jpeg)

## Quadrillion connections

Our brains are giant graphs. Of nodes known as neurones. And edges known as synapses. An infant's brain contains nearly 100 billion neurones. And about one quadrillion synapses.

When we think of some concept, say "election", we stimulate associated neurones. And when we do so, synapses connected to those neurones are also stimulated. These, in turn, stimulate other neurones associated with the concept. Like "president", "voting" or "democracy".

Note, the mapping from concept to neurone is vague and weak at best. We might think of "election" as a single well-defined concept. But our brains represent it within many neurones. And these neurones also express other concepts.

## Re-wiring the graph

>>> "5 billion years ago, matter, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics." — Yuval Noah Hariri

Reading is like thinking. Each time we read a word ("billion"), or phrase ("5 billion years ago"), that parts of our brain that are associated with these words or phrases are stimulated. Related regions of the brain, say, the region associated with "Big Bang", are also stimulated.

This stimulation causes our brain to be re-wired. Neurones learn to represent new concepts. And the synapses between these concepts are strengthened.

Sometimes, the concepts we read, closely match the concepts in our brain . In such situations, we feel that our reading is "easy" or "light". The re-wiring of our brain is minimal.

At other times, the concepts we read are very different. We feel that reading is "difficult" and "heavy". Sometimes heavy-reading takes a physical toll. And we feel drowsy. Or even fall asleep.

At yet other times, we read concepts that mostly match our brains. But then, these concepts blossom into new ideas, not in our brains. In such situations, we are surprised, delighted, entertained, and inspired. Such serendipity occurs when a good reader has the good fortune to encounter a good writer.

## How to be a good reader

* Understand how your brain works. Start with the familiar (concepts that match your brains concepts), leaving the unfamiliar for later. It's ok to skim. Browse. I usually start with the contents or index. Often the "introduction" or the "conclusion".

* Give your brain the opportunity to be re-wired often. Re-read books. Even if you think you know what's in the book. The best books must be read often.

* Let yourself be familiar with a broader range of books. Read widely. Not just a few genres and authors. The neurones and synapses you strengthen from one genre would complement the reading of another.

* Try not to "do" anything when you read. Try to "be". The re-wiring of our brains is a sub-conscious process. If we try to "do" reading, we mess-up this process. For example, many people try to make sure that they remember everything they read. This "doing memorisation" leads to all sorts of sub-optimal connections.

* Don't "think" about what you've read. Reflect and contemplate on what you read. Put down the book from time to time, and just "not think". But "feel your mind". This will eventually help you "feel" the new connections that are formed. Leading to new and creative ideas. If you "think", all you'll end-up is unearthing old and mundane thoughts.

## And not just books

I titled this article "How to read a book". But "read" could be replaced with any "information consumption" activity. And "book" could be replaced by other sources of information.

This article could just as well be "How to watch a movie" or "How to listen to music".

# Confessions of a Compulsive Coffee Consumer

### Dos and Don'ts

## Do drink blends of coffee you're familiar with.

Or blends that are similar to these blends. Familiarity builds attraction. You are more likely to like familiar flavours.

## Do understand what you like about coffee.

What are the characteristics of coffee that you like? Do you like acidity? Or bitterness? Or are their flavours (or "notes") you like? Identify these and look for these.

## Don't consume too often.

When you eat or drink anything (coffee included), you develop a "memory" of the experience. This memory discourages you from consuming more of the same thing. It's our bodies way of saying "moderation!".

Leave at least several hours between cups for the best experience. If there is a coffee or cafe that you particularly like, limit even further. Several days. Or even weeks.

## Do look forward to drinking coffee.

If you know you're going to have a cuppa in an hour, that's something good to look forward to.

On the other hand, don't let the interval be too long. If you're checking out a new cafe (which is supposed to be awesome) in two weeks time, it's probably best to forget it.

## Do make an effort.

Making coffee yourself has a fantastic IKEA effect. Ideally, make coffee from "first principles". Roast the beans, grind them by hand, and brew it in an old-fashioned stove-top Moka pot.

Consume the beverage in pleasant circumstances. If you're living room is a mess, clean first, consume second. The drinking will be all the more pleasurable.

Happy Drinking!

# How to be an Ignoramus

### On #SkinInTheGame, Shaky Knowledge and Magic Words

In the original Latin, ignoramus means something like "We do not know".

This article is about a subset of people who are not Ignoramii. People who say "We do know", but don't.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3Po17-54vXSaP3SuSdFCZQ.jpeg)

## Why do people say "We do know", when they don't?

There are at least three reasons. The first two are a paradox.

### Reason 1: #SkinInTheGame

Too many people who say "We do know" have an ulterior motive for saying so.

For example, they might have won an award or position for claiming to know X. Even a Nobel prize, or a consulting job in a multinational company. Or a prestigious university. If they back track and say "I don't know X", or "I was wrong about X", they might lose the position or prize money or both.

This type of #SkinInTheGame is not restricted to professors and experts.

For example, if you're a lowly researcher working for (say) a left-wing think tank, you have to "know" that left-wing is the "right"-wing. If you don't know that, you'll get fired. If you're an organiser for the purple political party, then all their policies must be perfect. If you don't pontificate that "purple is perfectly perfect", they'll ask you to leave.

And not everyone who has #SkinInTheGame gets paid for it. A lot of "skin" is non-monetary. Like ego or loyalty.

### Reason 2: No #SkinInTheGame

While many people have some #SkinInTheGame, they don't have enough #SkinInTheGame.

For example, you might have won a Nobel Prize for your crack-pot economic theory. But you don't pay for it when corporations and nations implement your ideas and go bust.

Just as Astrologers claim "You must have got the birth-time wrong", you blame the failure on some external factor. You write another paper on this external factor and get another Nobel prize.

Hence, paradoxically the problem with many "Don't know, but say we know"-types is that they have enough #SkinInTheGame to make them influential (and dangerous). But not enough #SkinInTheGame to make them self reflect and regulate.

### Reason 3: Shaky Ground

There are three ways of "knowing" things.

* Class 1. First Principles. You build up a theory, which is precisely reasoned from foundational theories. Like Mathematics. And some areas of applied mathematics like Physics and Computer science.

* Class 2. Significant Evidence. Your area is too complex to understand from first principles. So you run experiments, collect large amounts of data, and build theories based on the statistically significant outcomes. Much of Chemistry, Biology and Medicine is based on this type of "knowing".

* Class 3: Insignificant Evidence. Like Class 2, your area is very complicated. However, it is also not possible to collect enough data to form statistically significant theories. The Social Sciences and History broadly fall into this bucket.

The goal of this classification is not to put down some academic fields under others. My goal was to compare people, not areas.

Also, in practice, most fields overlap across multiple classes. While much of Computer Science knowledge is Class 1, it has many examples of Class 3. For example, all but the most trivial computer systems are highly complex. And it is almost impossible to prove for sure if (say) that system is bug-free.

But as I said, the classification was intended to describe people.

When something you know is Class 1, you can be very confident about its correctness. For example, Pythagoras would have been supremely confident about his eponymous theorem.

At the other extreme, if you were Milton Friedman (say), almost everything you'd say would be statistically insignificant garbage. You can't prove anything rationally. So the only way to promote your ideas would be to force people to believe. By influencing governments and politicians. Or by talking a lot.

Hence, one reason people say "We do know" when they don't know is because they hope (often correctly) that a lie said many times would turn true.

Again, my goal is not to debunk "areas". Most "Class 3" areas have led to interesting and useful data. The work is highly valuable. The problem is trying to theorise and generalise based on insufficient data. That's what leads to naughtiness.

## So, what to do?

Hence, as we can see people who say "We do know", but don't, are the worst possible way atomic particles can aggregate as matter. They must be abolished or worse.

One way of making sure that their numbers don't swell even further is by making sure we don't join them. It's not very difficult to be an ignoramus.

* Make sure you don't have #SkinInTheGame. Don't take on jobs or accept prizes that depend on something you don't know for sure. If you do, make sure it is Class 1 or Class 2 knowledge.

* If you do take on prizes or jobs, be honourable and also take on some #SkinInTheGame. Offer to return the prize money or salary if you're proved wrong.

* Don't claim to know things that are on Shaky Ground. Always qualify what you say with the magic words "But I don't know...".

Welcome to the global fellowship of Ignoramii!

Easy. The journey thus far. Enjoyable even.

But I see a fork. Why do I want to take the high road?

The low road is so...alien.

Since itself forked off, it has brought me only bliss. And a sort of bliss that can only increase. Not diminish.

But it is alien.

For not once, did I need to look at my watch. Is it time for lunch? Should I take a break? Am I being followed? Not once.

Time seems to have stopped. Or disappeared completely.

Alien.

For not once have I thought about the future or the past.

Those great repositories of all those things that I should have done but didn't do. And should do but won't.

Alien, because it is free of time. And all that comes with time. All that is time.

And I see the fork in the road. And I see that path back to the high road. The high road. With its troubles and pains. That high road of "time".

And I see my self. Uncontrollably. Taking steps toward it.

# (Not so) Proportional Representation

### On Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections

The Parliament of Sri Lanka has 225 member seats. The 22 electoral districts elect 196 seats. Each party receives seats in proportion to the votes it received in that district. The remaining 29 seats are the "national list". Each party receives national list seats, in proportion to the votes it receives islandwide.

At first glance, it might seem that our proportional representation system is indeed "proportional". The reality is different. And that is what this article discusses.

## District Level Disproportionalities

The Puttalam electoral district has 8 seats. In the 2015 general election, the UNP got 180,185 votes, the UPFA 153,130 votes, while other parties got 24,193 votes.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WQbRXURDTJyH-ZuqYkal4g.png)

If we were to allocate the 8 seats exactly proportionally, the UNP, UPFA and Others would get 4.03, 3.43 and 0.54 seats respectively. Since we can't allocate fractions of seats, we could round these numbers to get 4, 3 and 1. This might seem like a fair allocation.

In reality, the UNP got 5 seats, the UPFA 3 seats, and no seats were allocated to the other parties. There are three reasons for the "unfairness".

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ecJCmCujvaungKPmMNzVxg.png)

### The Bonus Seat

First, according to our constitution, the party with the highest votes of each electoral district gets a "bonus seat". Hence, the UNP got 1 bonus seat. Thus, even if a party is "highest" by just one extra vote, it gets a bonus seat.

### The 5% Limit

Second, parties receiving less than 5% of the vote, don't qualify for seats. Hence, none of the "Other" parties (all of which got less than 5%) got seats. It also means that the parties that do end up getting more than 5% need fewer votes per seat.

The remaining seats after allocating the bonus (In Puttalam's case, 7), are allocated proportionally to the parties that have more than 5% of the total vote, using the "Largest remainder method".

The Largest Remainder Method works as follows:

* Step 1. Each party is allocated a rounded-down whole number of proportional votes

* Step 2. The remaining votes are allocated to the party or parties with the largest remainder

For example, excluding the "Others" and dividing proportionally, the UNP and UPFA should get 3.78 and 3.22 seats respectively. Hence, each is first assigned 3 seats each.

This leaves remainders of 0.78 and 0.22 for the UNP and UPFA, and one remaining seat. Since the UNP has the highest remainder, it is assigned the remaining 1 seat.

### Rounding Luck

Hence, thirdly, because of rounding, a party could get a lucky round-up, or an unlucky round-down.

The final effect is that the UNP got a seat for every 36,037 votes, and the UPFA got one for every 51,043. The others, despite getting 24,193 votes, got no seats.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OFYkFB7WSqhM4cplBIj4SQ.png)

## National Level Disproportionalities

The recently concluded 2019 presidential election had 15,992,096 registered voters. Hence, we could expect the 196 electoral district seats to be allocated for every 81,592 votes. However, if we compare "registered voters/seat" across districts, there are significant differences.

At one extreme, Gampaha district has 97,327 voters per seat. At the other, the Vanni district has 47,020 per seat, or less than half of Gampaha. Overall, we notice districts with small populations have fewer voters per seat.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*puNiv-4q7nj8WzK3iSfipg.png)

What is the reason for this difference?

Not all the 196 seats are allocated to electoral districts in proportion to voter population. Only 160 are. The remaining 36 are equally allocated to each of the 9 provinces. Or 4 per province.

Hence, the Western province (with over 4M registered voters) and the Northern province (with 800K registered voters), gets the same 4 seats each.

Thus, it is easier (i.e. you need fewer voters) to win a seat in a smaller province.

## An Alternative (but currently unconstitutional) Allocation

If we assigned the 196 in proportion to the district's registered voters (using the same Largest Remainder Method), the allocation of seats would be as follows:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SBmJzez7Q73tyWHYaD5Xbw.png)

The smaller districts would have fewer seats. The larger would have more. And the ones in the middle would have no change. But the Voters/Seat is much fairer.

## A Hypothetical Example

(Not a prediction for the next general election)

Suppose the next general election has the same results (party-wise) as the recently concluded presidential election. Also, suppose we are generous and assign all the "Other" votes to the JVP (very generous).

Then, by our current not-so proportional representation scheme, each party would receive the following numbers of seats.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GYKe3LVAtOtMnybEDmi_DA.png)

By our alternative properly proportional scheme:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5Qk_nD_otlOo5urkJq3Qyg.png)

## Concluding thoughts

I'm not sure what the thinking behind the "bonus" and the 36 seats for the provinces was. Either way, these asymmetries seem to cause some unfairnesses. Though, it is unclear (to me) how significant these are.

# The "Map"

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

There has been some controversy over various maps depicting the results of the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election. The "Eelam"-word has come up several times, and parts of the country have been accused of disloyalty.

I also got "feedback" about the "potentially divisive nature" of the map I used for my "real-time" updates:

>>> 

## "Win" Maps

At the end of the day, only one map actually matters. The SLPP's Gotabhaya Rajapaksa won with 52.2% of the vote. True — not as much as President Kumaratunga's 62.28% in 1994. But there's no such thing as a 52.2% president. A president is a president.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9bfsr2Lu39RuCrp7coLGcA.png)

The SLPP "won" (i.e. got more votes) in all but the Northern and Eastern provinces.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IVUWzyUaDGnPtYWWERCLpA.png)

At an Electoral District level, it won all but the five electoral districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces and the Nuwara-Eliya district.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LRIXV1T3FVA8iomzJLgupw.png)

Of the 160 polling divisions, the SLPP won 114, to the NDFs 46.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YImpwqRIYvsCf3WHWJF4VA.png)

## More Nuanced Maps

But obviously, these maps are incomplete. "Winning" a polling division, electoral district, or province doesn't imply that everyone there voted for you. Nor does "losing" imply that no-one did.

If we use a continuous colour palette, we get far more nuanced maps:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N66GHpkcstrUCezWUTN9tA.png)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4Y5Rz86k4g3GYkJRcuRJ8w.png)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nsqf3fhloqnOIgVe9yoXQw.png)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JH6zuV2T0iY_RkHHs9Etvg.png)

## Even Better Maps

But even these maps are misleading because democracy involves "one person with one vote", not "one square-kilometre, with one vote". Densely populated parts of the country are underrepresented in this map.

A even better representation is this Dorling Cartogram:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h9NYOrdaBrWdfwyl3W-Ikg.png)

The area of each circle is proportional to the number of total votes in the polling division. The label denotes the electoral district of the polling division (e.g. "Co" is Colombo).

## Concluding Reflections

On the one had, a map is a map. No map is a perfect representation. And reading too much into maps is a waste of time. As is reading too much into any model. That fallacy is known as "false-precision". Or seeing things that don't exist.

On the other hand, maps are highly emotive entities. A line or shade in the wrong place can ignite many hearts.

So, I advise myself, map with care!

In 2015, the UPFA's Mahinda Rajapaksa won 47.6% of the vote. Or 2.4% behind the magic 50% finish line. To win in 2019, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa needed to gain at least 2.4% of the vote. In electoral jargon, this "gain" is known as the "swing".

## Swing

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's SLPP ended up gaining a swing of about 4.7% island-wide, ending on 52.2%.

While the Northern province swung towards the NDF. The Western, Southern and North-Central provinces swung to the SLPP. The other provinces didn't swing by much.

At an electoral district level, as expected, the Polonnaruwa district swung back to the SLPP. More significantly, the majority of the votes in the swing came from the Colombo, Gampaha, Galle and Matara districts. Hence, a "West Coast Swing".

Zooming further, at a polling division level, it is clear that the swing was densest on the "coast".

## Gains and Holds

In 2015, the NDF won 70 of the 160 polling divisions, to the UPFA's 90. In 2019, the SLPP not only managed to "hold" onto all 90, but also gained 24 polling divisions that the NDF won in 2015.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4ebpk49o9YxkunCBNVd9BA.png)

Among these 24 were all 8 of the "Pure Bellwether" polling divisions. Katana, Ja-Ela, Ratmalana, Moratuwa, Mawathagama, Medirigiriya, Minneriya and Polonnaruwa. The winning candidate in all eight presidential elections has won each of these Bellwethers.

In 2015, the NDF won 12 electoral districts, to the UPFA's 10. In 2019, the SLPP held all 10, and also gained 6: Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy, Badulla, Puttalam and Polonnaruwa. Polonnaruwa remains the sole "Bellwether Electoral District". The winning candidate has won Polonnaruwa in all eight presidential elections.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K88tc4BiNgGie7a3Mu27sQ.png)

Zooming out, the SLPP held onto the five provinces that the UPFA won in 2015, and also gained the Western and Central provinces from the NDF.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DYanY9n_ML5o8vPfv3DJhg.png)

While "swing" is meaningful, "gains" and "holds" are less meaningful in "non-first-past-the-post" elections. On the other hand, one "gain" is definitely significant. The biggest gain of all.

# Why the Greens Lost

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

## Base and Float

A "base voter" of a political party is a voter who votes for that party no matter what. A guaranteed vote for the party. In On Floating Voters, I estimated that the SLPP had a "base" of about 44% of the total vote, and the NDF about 39%.

The remaining "floating voters" could vote for either party. This latter block usually ends-up deciding the outcome of the election.

Using the data from the 2019 election (together with previous elections), I re-estimated these numbers. The SLPP had a "base" of about 43.6%, and the NDF a somewhat reduced base of 37.0%. This left a floating vote of about 19.4%.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*paJjOc7vx2qIgVpQlJGobw.png)

The floating vote distributed across the island as follows:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NR0pYCPG-r_kE4XT-_4SDw.png)

With a 37.0% base, the NDF needed a further 13% to win the election. The SLPP, on the other hand, with a substantial 43.6% base, needed only 6.4%. Hence, the NDF had a much harder task before them.

## Performance in Elections

In 2015, the Greens managed to secure a significant majority of the floating vote across the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fjtaul76Z7V5zsCqZFHRfg.png)

Conversely, in 2005, they failed, particularly in the Western Province. Many people (reasonably) cite the "LTTE-Boycott" as a reason for the Green defeat. But if they had done a better job with the floating vote, they might have still won. Note all the "white spots" in the Western Province.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LWeXhgA7HBHAjp8b1OY5bw.png)

The Green's performance was even worse in 2019.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CtdWKOp7XZ1nIboZyMtYQg.png)

Let's break this down.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mqJ0JiOzTbbLIZ3epDdZcA.png)

The NDF dominated the floating vote in the Nothern and Eastern province. But more significantly, the SLPP won a majority of the floating vote in the Central, Western, and other Provinces.

Even though the SLPP won smaller percentages of floating votes, their absolute numbers were much larger.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k1q3hrqDG6ikmzcJHowJZg.png)

The NDF needed more than 13% of votes from floating voters. But they managed 5.4%. On the other hand, the SLPP needed only more than 6%. And they comfortably exceeded this goal.

## What next?

The Green base vote continues to wane. It has dropped from 39% in 2015 to 37% in 2019. Hence, the Greens need to rely more and more on floating votes.

Consider the 2019 election. Suppose the Greens won 80% of the floating vote in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. And 70% in Central and Western (far better than they did). They would still have needed 60% of the floating vote from the rest of the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tUgI1oTHp4heF0iarsiSRQ.png)

The Northern and Eastern targets seem difficult, but doable. But the Central, Western and "Rest of the Country" targets seem challenging. At best.

The Greens don't seem to have any message that appeals to the majority of the floating vote. Even if they do, that message is not resonating. While that might not be the exact cause of "Why the Greens Lost", it is clearly an effect.

You might argue (reasonably) that there were many other reasons. From disproportionate media attention to #FakeNews to "ever-green" @RW_UNP. But the bottom line is this: they only won 5.4% from the floating vote. When they needed 13%.

There is no overnight solution. Turning things around will take years, if not decades. But if I were a Green, I would ask the following questions (in increasing order of difficulty):

* How can we win more of the "Central Province" floating vote?

* How can we win more of the "Western Province" floating vote?

* How can we win more of the "Rest of the Country" floating vote?

* How can we increase our (currently waning) base?

Without good answers, there is little hope for what was Sri Lanka's premier political party.

# Monkey Business

### 2019 Sri Lanka Presidential Elections

During the lead up to the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election, many tried to predict the outcome. Some even emailed me detailed "analyses" on how they arrived at their conclusions.

Here are predictions from 11 "human" "experts". For clarity, I only include their forecast for the winning SLPP.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p5Ly1h_BR_rz26kZ8c__hA.png)

Some asked me to "evaluate" their predictions. Had they got it right?

In almost all cases, the key numbers were derived from opinion and assumptions. For example, "80% of SLFP supporters would vote for the SLPP", where the number was not derived from a survey of SLFP supporters, but purely the author's opinion. Hence, it was possible to dismiss analyses purely qualitatively. Without even looking at the numbers.

However, a few analyses came up with predictions reasonably close to the final result. And a couple of the authors sent "Hey! You pooh-poohed me. But I got it right. I'm a genius"-type, self-congratulatory emails.

Now, you might correctly point out that a few "experts" got lucky. But can we prove it? Can we separate the humans from the monkeys?

## The Monkey Test (Part 1)

Can we design a statistical test to answer the question, "Is the expert actually an expert, or a monkey?"

In statistics-speak, "The expert is a monkey" is known as the "Null-Hypothesis". "The expert is an expert" is known as the "Alternative Hypothesis".

The test begins by asking the question, "Could the predictions have come from a bunch of monkeys?"

So, I went off to Dehiwala Zoo. And asked in an assortment of apes to fill in a questionnaire with their predictions. Compensating each participant with a Kolikuttu.

Actually, I made that bit up. The Zoo was closed. And I'm not sure if the apes would have corporated, even for Kolikuttus. So, I "simulated" a monkey.

In On Floating Voters, I speculated that the SLPP should get between 44% and 61% of the vote. So, I wrote a bit of code that randomly picks a number between 44% and 61%.

```
import randomfor i in range(0, 100):   print([0.44 + 0.17 * random.random())
```

The 100 "monkey predictions" were as follows (sorted in increasing order):

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hUT0WDvzv4H0gCcyYxJtJQ.png)

Here are the absolute errors for the predictions.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Am6duTHIiKj6DfR7MwDjzg.png)

One monkey (red) predicted 52.19% for the SLPP, just 0.6% from the actual 52.25% that the SLPP got. Nine other monkeys (orange), arrived within 1%, and 12 others within 2%.

## The Monkey Test (Part 2)

Now, back to our Null and Alternative Hypotheses.

If a random man claims to be able to predict the election, it is natural to be sceptical. The chances are that he is a monkey. So we bias towards the Null Hypothesis. We ask "What is the probability that what this man says could have been said by a Monkey?". And if this probability is not smaller than a small number (say 5% or 10%), then we conclude that the man is a monkey. In statistics speak, this is called "Hypothesis Testing".

For example, 10 of our 100 monkeys got within 1% of the final result. So, if our random man's predictions are off my more than 1%, we'll have to conclude that he is a monkey. Or more formally, "There is no evidence, at a 10% significance level, to conclude that the man is not a monkey".

So, how did our "experts" do?

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*koP9AYS8CPwVa5OokXrslQ.png)

Of our 11 experts, only one predicted within 1% of the final result. Hence, we could conclude that "There is no evidence, at a 10% significance level, to conclude that any of the other 10 are not monkeys".

Actually, 5% significance is more common in statistical analyses than 10%. Hence, we could probably conclude that "There is no evidence, at a 5% significance level, to conclude that any of our experts are not monkeys".

## Concluding suggestions

You might retort, "Can any human expert prove that they are not a monkey? 1% is too hard".

And of course, you're right. It is tough to predict elections accurately. If there was one point I tried to make in my pre-election articles, it was this point. An accurate prediction requires a lot of data and a lot of hard work.

On the other hand, it is quite easy to guess and get lucky. As we saw, some of our monkeys were a lot luckier than many of our experts. Hence, you have to prove that you did not get lucky.

How do you do that?

* Prove that you have data. Like wide-ranging surveys from many people.

* Prove that you have done this in the past, and have got it right.

* Prove that you have #SkinInTheGame. What you have to lose if you get your prediction wrong

# On Pleasure

### And Survival, Mangos and Hot Chocolate

## Survival

Let's talk about pleasure.

On the one hand, we all know how pleasure feels. Whether it is our favourite dessert. Or good news. Or meeting a long-lost friend after a long time. We all know the feeling.

On the other hand, can we describe it? What is pleasure? Is any one type of pleasure any different from any other?

The only thing I can say for sure about pleasure is that I want more of it.

And this is also how evolutionary psychologists define pleasure. Pleasure is an innate motivation that drives us to do things that are good for us. Where "good" means "characteristics that help us survive". Hence, eating is pleasurable, because we need food. The same applies to sleep and sex.

Note, this is a very narrow definition of "good". It is not innately good in any absolute sense. It merely helps us survive.

Also, "helps us survive" is only accurate in a broad, long-term context.

## Mangos

Suppose a cave-person ancestor of ours encountered a tree full of mangos. Given that energy and nourishment were scarce, it would have been smart to devour as many mangos, before they rotted, or were eaten by monkeys.

Hence, eating Mangos was pleasurable. These days most foods (including mangos) are not scarce, and we don't need to binge-eat all the time. However, the instinct to do so remains. Hence, the urge to decimate that tub of ice-cream in the fridge.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HJTSleRtqBGFhpBDzqzaag.jpeg)

Hence, in the modern world, many definitions of "good" have done a U-turn. Food that is "good" for you is almost certainly not the most pleasurable food. Some nutritionists even recommend fasting — the ultimate "non-food" — as the best diet. The same applies to many other types of pleasure. What is most pleasurable is not what is "good" for us.

But there is a problem. We all want pleasure. It's one of the few things that seem to bring meaning to our otherwise meaningless lives.

So what to do?

Let's do some hypothetical fantasising. What if we could make eating an undressed salad as pleasurable as eating our favourite dessert? Or even better, what if fasting could be made as pleasurable?

Is this possible? To speculate, let's analyse pleasure in more detail.

## Hot Chocolate

Suppose we are drinking our favourite hot chocolate. Thick, bitter and sweet. When we taste the sugar and chocolate, and they hit our blood-stream, our bodies secrete various pleasure-inducing chemicals. This is the "pleasure" that we feel.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EcJbr9IYfzdqh9h5E5HElg.jpeg)

How do these chemicals work? We don't know. What we feel is a complicated emergent effect caused by these chemicals. Which are themselves, quite complicated. An evolutionary biologist would describe this back to front.

It is not that these chemicals cause pleasure. It is that only the humans that felt the effect of the chemicals as pleasurable survived. The other humans, who didn't find pleasure in sugar, sex, sleep, or chocolate, didn't survive.

This is both shocking and liberating.

It is shocking because, pleasure, something we feel to be very real, is, at some deep level, not real. It is a sort of arbitrary choice. We, humans, have arbitrarily chosen to recognised somethings as pleasurable because it is good for survival.

But it is also liberating. Because if it is a choice, we can change our choice. We could choose not to see dessert as pleasurable. And choose to see undressed salad or fasting as pleasurable instead.

The question is, how.

How do we get to that deep level, where we choose between pleasure and non-pleasure?

# My Sabbath Resolution

### They say you need to "Slow Down to See the Beauty"...

[First Published on Facebook. June 2007]

Ever since ending my days as a University student, I've found my self travelling by car more and more and walking less and less। I am not a fitness freak — but I did begin to feel that I was missing out on a fairly decent bit of exercise. So I came up with a unique (if not slightly unusual) remedy to the predicament: My "Sabbath Resolution"

>>> I resolved not to travel by car (or any other form of transport utilizing combustion engines) from dawn to dusk on Saturdays.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PdYDBh6MYf6DeMJsj1C9-w.jpeg)

That was some time ago. Now my typical Saturday chores are all done in pedis. If, on a hot Saturday afternoon, you chance to see a guy trekking the boulevards of Colombo, with a knap-sack on his back, a smile on his face, a song on his lips and Wrigley's in his mouth, that's probably me.

Something that I've noticed on my road rambles is that I seem to "bump into" people I know (literally) in the most unlikely places (geographically, not anatomically). Even more intriguing is that I meet people in places where I just happen to be "by chance", who also in turn happen to be in those places "just by chance". For example (and this is just one of quite a handful), I always seem to encounter a certain old friend of mine in her car at the Lipton Circus traffic lights. The odd thing is that this is not necessarily at some particular time of the day — she's not there for any particular reason — nor am I. I don't know whether it's just that I am remembering and "noticing" these close encounters more vividly while on foot, or whether probability is playing some kind of a trick. Whatever it is, it seems to have changed the way I look at...well...things. Are we mssing out on some things in this world? Do we listen when we should? Or do we even know that we should listen?

By now, my Sabbath Resolution has settled in nicely as a habit. Yesterday, I was passing townhall on my way home. It was around 6.45 in the evening. Sunset. The breeze was really cool (in every sense of the word). In the backdrop of the townhall was a sky that was a mixture of emerald and sapphire. The earliest stars were coming to radiance and the crows returning to nest seemed to soar over the twinkles...I know this is just a typical view of boring old Colombo — but from a certain angle it does look different, even beautiful...

So, what have I really gained from my Sabbath Resolution? A few pounds saved, definitely, but anything else? Maybe I've started to realize that that you need to "Slow Down to See the Beauty"...

"Slow Down to See Life"...

"Slow Down to really understand"...

### The Gotabaya Rajapaksa Cabinet

# Why I'll be voting for women

You might have seen some memes complaining about the gender and ethnic composition of the new Gotabaya Rajapaksa Cabinet. Particularly, that there was only one woman, and no Moor members.

I pulled some numbers from Wikipedia, to analyze this complaint.

## Women

51% of Sri Lankans are female. If parliament reflected this ratio, we would have 115 female MPs. Instead, we have only 12.

While some parties appear to have a few more women tha others, the differences are not statistically signifcant. All parties do an abysmal job at attracting women members.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X9Atf4LFptwg2jQJA2Vh1w.png)

The single woman in the Cabinet merely reflects this overall shortage.

Even having zero women of the 38 state and deputy ministers is not "unfair" given that there are only 12 to start with. If we randomly assign members to batches of 38, about 10% will not include any women. Hence, we can't conclude at a 10% significance level that the 38 is "unfair to women — given the composition of parliament".

## Minorities

If parliament reflected proportions of Sinhala, Tamil and Moor ethnicities in Sri Lanka, we would have 169, 35 and 21 Sinhala, Tamil and Moor MPs respectively. The actual numbers are not very different, with slightly more Sinhala MPs, fewer Tamil MPs. Ratios across parties, on the other hand, vary significantly.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bbHEDOQGvBCKZwVDADh-DQ.png)

What about the claim that having no Moor MPs in the cabinet is unfair? Since UPFA has only three Moor MPs to start with, again we can't conclude that "Moors have been treated unfairly".

Of course, there is the question of why the UPFA has fewer Tamils and Moors to start with. But that is a different question. Cabinets and ministers are picked out of the pool of MPs.

## Vote for Women

Ethnicity and religion dominates Sri Lankan politics. While there is discrimination, and inequity along these lines, these problems are small compared to those along gender lines. As in most walks of life, women are the true "persecuted majority".

During the next general election (which will likely be in March or April 2020), I'm going to cast my preference to a female candidate. My choice is not based on "positive discrimination" or "affirmative action", but because I'm confident that there will be strong and capable female candidates representing the Colombo Electoral District (my district), and others.

Too many voters vote for men because they believe "woman make poor politicians" or because "politics is a man's job". In other words, most voters actually "positively discrimate" towards men. The end result is that we end-up electing a bunch of nitwits and criminals to parliament. Let's not make this eternal mistake yet again.

Happy voting!

### 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

# The Minority Report

Many have described the recent Sri Lankan Presidential Election as ethnically polarised. Some have even simplified the results to "The majority voted for Gota. Minorities voted for Sajith".

How accurate is this claim of polarisation?

In this article, I attempt a data-driven answer to this question.

## Non-Approach: A perfect answer

Suppose each ballot paper included the voter's ethnicity. Then we would be able to accurately answer all manner of questions around voting and ethnicity. And not just ethnicity. More data about age, gender, religion, and income would also yield interesting insights.

Sadly, (and perhaps happily), this is not the case. Voting is by secret ballot and includes no meta-data about the voter's profile. Hence, we need to resort to approximate estimates.

## Approach 1: A sure, but weak answer

### An imaginary polling division

Suppose an imaginary polling division has 100,000 voters: 80,000 Tamil and 20,000 Sinhala. Suppose the NDF won 80,000 votes, and the SLPP won 20,000 votes. What can we conclude?

On the one hand, we could assume that all the Tamil voters voted for the NDF, while all the Sinhala voters voted SLPP. This would be consistent with the data.

But this is not the only conclusion consistent with the data. For example, all 20,000 Sinhala voters could have voted for the NDF, with the SLPP getting all its votes from Tamil Voters. This might be inconsistent with the intuitions (and prejudices) of many. But it is still consistent with the data.

So what can we conclude? For sure?

We can conclude that the NDF won at least 60,000 Tamil Votes. Why? Because the most number of Non-Tamil votes it could have got was 20,000. We can also trivially conclude that the NDF won at most 80,000 Tamil Votes.

Hence, our conclusions are: The NDF won 60,000 to 80,000 (75% to 100%) Tamil votes, and 0 to 20,000 (0 to 100%) Sinhala votes.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RpyhI1rGL_FzXc_PcDfIhA.png)

### Sri Lanka

If we extend this logic to the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election, and the 160 polling divisions, we get the following numbers:

* Moor votes for NDF: 21% to 99%

* Tamil votes for NDF: 43% to 95%

* Sinhala votes for NDF: 27% to 43%

* Moor + Tamil votes for NDF: 41% to 93%

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3HpmjNuIhwRCY9lAyKBT6g.png)

Similarly,

* Moor votes for SLPP: 1% to 74%

* Tamil votes for SLPP: 2% to 51%

* Sinhala votes for SLPP: 51% to 67%

* Moor + Tamil votes for SLPP: 4% to 54%

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*icWVOLJNx6WTkwh9_7lMCA.png)

[Note, "Tamil" includes both "Sri Lankan Tamil" and "Indian Tamil". "Moor" includes "Malay" and "Moor". Ethnicities <1% of the total population have been excluded]

## Approach 2: A less-sure, but the more-powerful answer

The above estimate is "sure" because we make no assumptions. On the other hand, it is "weak" because it predicts a wide range. Saying "Moor votes for SLPP: 1% to 74%" while true, is not very useful.

Can we reduce the range of the estimate? Could we make the estimate more powerful?

To gain power, we need to sacrifice "sure-ness". In other words, we need to make some assumptions.

### "Sri Lankan's vote along ethnic lines"

A blunt, but common assumption is that "Sri Lankan's vote along ethnic lines". For example, "X% of Sinhala Voters vote SLPP nation-wide" or "Y% of Tamil Voters vote NDF nation-wide". If we assume that this is true for all polling divisions, we can build a model that estimates X and Y.

```
NDF  = Moor * 86% + Tamil * 83% + Sinhala * 27%   ± 3%
```

Simple Linear Regression models which predict the SLPP vote share, and NDF vote share based on the proportions of ethnicities, take the following forms:

```
SLPP = Moor * 13% + Tamil * 8% + Sinhala * 65%   ± 3%
```

```
NDF  = Moor * 86% + Tamil * 83% + Sinhala * 27%   ± 3%
```

What does the "model think" about how ethnicities vote? The clue is in the model equation.

"SLPP = Moor * 13% + Tamil * 8% + Sinhala * 65%" implies that the "model thought" 13%, 8% and 65% Moor, Tamil and Sinhala voters respectively vote SLPP. Similarly, 86%, 83% and 27% voted NDF.

The ± 3% indicates to what degree the model is sure (or "unsure").

To evaluate the model, we merely plug-in the proportions of ethnicities.

### Sinhala Majority

For example, consider an Beliatta, which is almost 100% Sinhala. The model predicts:

```
SLPP = 0% * 13% + 0% *  8% + 100% * 65% = 65% ± 3%
```

```
NDF  = 0% * 86% + 0% * 83% + 100% * 27%= 27% ± 3%
```

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7MoX0LHp_xLxEQAdarCpFg.png)

This is quite close to the actual result.

### Tamil Majority

Udupiddy is almost 100% Tamil.

```
SLPP = 0% * 13% + 100% * 8% + 0% * 65% = 8% ± 3%
```

```
NDF  = 0% * 86% + 100% * 83% + 0% * 27%= 83% ± 3%
```

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fioaQUXztjQ5bcPj-laPjw.png)

Again, quite close.

### Moor Majority

Sammanthurai has the highest proportion of Moors, with 83% Moor, 15% Tamil, and 1% Sinhala.

```
SLPP = 83% * 13% + 15% * 8% +  1% * 65% = 11% ± 3%
```

```
NDF  = 83% * 86% + 15% * 83% + 1% * 27%= 86% ± 3%
```

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RFuSC8hxWsz-KGVYoANRUQ.png)

### Multi-Ethnic

Pottuvil is Sri Lanka's most "multi-ethnic" polling division. With 38% Moor, 32% Tamil and 29% Sinhala.

```
SLPP = 38% * 13% + 32% *  8% + 29% * 65% = 26% ± 3%
```

```
NDF  = 38% * 86% + 32% * 83% + 29% * 27%= 69% ± 3%
```

Less accurate, but directionally correct.

### Sri Lanka

Using the proportions of ethnicities, and the number of votes in each polling division, we can estimate the number of voters by ethnicity. We get 9% Moor, 14% Tamil and 76% Sinhala. If we plug these into the model we get,

```
SLPP = 9% * 13% + 14% *  8% + 76% * 65% = 51% ± 3
```

```
NDF  = 9% * 86% + 14% * 83% + 76% * 27%= 42% ± 3%
```

## A Journey Through History

If we were to build models for all 8 presidential elections, and plot "what the model thought", we get the following:

Excluding the 1994 anomaly, minority support for the "Blue" parties has waned. Conversely, the "Greens" have had to rely more and more on minorities.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*btoFF3bs5LqldAru5zIHcQ.png)

## Concluding Warnings

While "Sri Lankan's vote along ethnic lines" might be accurate, it can't be generalised. I know many Moors and Tamils who voted for the SLPP, and Sinhalese who voted for the NDF.

This is also clear from the polling divisions where our "Approach 2: Model" had the highest error.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kp2BB07qXfo68k47AnpKvg.png)

There are two types of error: Minorities who voted for the SLPP (Kayts, Pottuvil, Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya, Kalkudah), and the majority who voted for the NDF ( Hewaheta, Mahiyanganaya, Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya, Ratnapura and Hakmana).

Both models and humans might assume that the Sri Lankan voter is a simple soul. Who votes by ethnicity and nothing else.

The reality is far more complicated.

# On the Five Precepts

### Are you a Buddhist?

Buddhists are expected to observe the Five Precepts (පන් සිල්). Or abstain from killing living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication.

Why?

## Commandments?

When I mentioned the Five Precepts to an Orthodox Jewish Friend, he at once drew a connection. "We also have commandments. Ten Commandments".

On the one hand, the Five Precepts are a type of "commandments". In fact, The fifth, sixth and seventh of the Ten Commandments of the Hebrew Bible, forbid murder, adultery and theft. Like the first, third and second precepts.

But on the other hand, the Five precepts are not commandments.

Firstly, they were not handed over by a divine being to a prophet on stone slabs on the top of a mountain. Secondly, there is no divine or heavenly reward for observing the Five Precepts.

You might argue that someone who keeps the Five Precepts acquires a lot of good Karma and hence should receive good things. But this too is not guaranteed. Karma is a complicated topic. Not some simple divine bank account.

## Social Code?

One could argue that individuals that observe precepts are beneficial to society. And I agree. A society where people don't murder, steal, commit adultery, lie, or take intoxicants would likely be peaceful.

But that is also not the point.

## Buddhist Training

Buddhists accept that existence is unsatisfactory. The cause of this unsatisfactoriness is craving.

When we "hate" something (say a mosquito perched on our arm), we "crave" a future where that thing (the mosquito) does not exist. We please craving by committing various unwholesome deeds (like swatting the mosquito). Committing these deeds reinforces our craving and future craving. A vicious cycle ensues.

Observing a precept like "abstain from killing living beings" puts some breaks on this cycle. This type of "break" is known as "higher virtue" (sila). Higher virtue is one of three types of "training" Buddhist should adopt. The other two being "higher mind" (citta) and "higher wisdom" (panna). Each "training" helps the other. For example, virtue helps the mind. And mind helps wisdom.

The cause of craving is ignorance. Identifying and understanding ignorance requires wisdom. Which in turn requires a developed mind. Which in turn requires virtue. The humble Five Precepts are the beginnings of this long process.

## Are you a Buddhist?

One acquires some "religions" by birth. If and only if one or both of your parents are of that religion, you are. Other religions by some ritual or purification process.

One acquires Buddhism through "training". Hence, if you're "born a Buddhist" or "perform all the processes and rituals", if you don't train yourself, you're not a Buddhist. The most basic form of training is observing the Five Precepts. If you don't keep the Five Precepts, you're not a Buddhist. Regardless of who your parents are or what else you do.

On the other hand, you might be a Buddhist even if you don't consider yourself one.

For example, if you observe an Abrahamic Faith (say Christianity, Islam or Judaism), you might already be keeping the Ten Hebrew Commandments. In which case, you are already "training" yourself in three of the five precepts. If you're a practising Muslim or a Pentecostal, you observe the fifth precept. You've already made some progress in "Buddhist Training", which makes you some kind of Buddhist.

On a personal note, I tend to like Sri Lankan parties with Muslim guests. Because I can mingle with them and not be forced to consume alcohol. Conversely, at 100% "Sinhala Buddhist" parties, the chances are that some "uncle" will try to force some booze down one's throat. We seem to have got the labels wrong.

# European Train Holiday

### 3372 km, 19 trains at an average speed of 93 kmph.

[First published as a Facebook Note in May 2016]

I've been fascinated by trains since I was a small child. I've wondered what a train-only vacation would look like; as in a vacation where I spend all of my "awake time" on a train. I'm about to find out. I've hastily planned such a vacation, comprising of some of my favourite rail sections in Europe.

## April 29th (Day 1–1146km, 6 trains)

### 1. London, United Kingdom to Brussels, Belgium (365 km at 170 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1NLo8hTyGisTCgdh)

I'm walking to Baker Street, to catch the Tube to St. Pancras. Someone (I can't recall who), once said if you have never missed a plane, you've probably wasted too much time in airports — and I've never missed a plane. And something I like about international travel by rail is you have none of the check-in 90 minutes before nonsense. However, this time I am worried that something, totally unexpected will go wrong (in the tube, or during security, or customs), and I will miss the Eurostar to Brussels by 30 seconds — leading to a domino effect. This entire train holiday depends on trains running on time, me keeping to a time table, with very little wiggle-room.

Well nothing has gone wrong yet. The new Eurostars look the part.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dRKaHb0seOJPrFx0)

The weather is good. England is lush and beautiful. Green fields and brown cottages. I drop into the Restaurant car to buy a coffee and some water, and am somewhat surprised that no one is looking out of the window. People look quite cheerful, and like me, probably look forward to a long-weekend's vacation.

In comparison, the post-tunnel part of France and Belgium is also green, but flatter. Less impressive. It's starting to rain.

I feel a bit uneasy, walking around Brussels Midi, after all the recent drama around terrorist attacks. But all seems calm and well.

### 2. Brussels to Cologne, Germany (221 km at 120 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Fj096rsBaqMyKy5c)

Brussels Nord is looking sad and gloomy. The rain is not helping. There's something about Brussels that makes me uneasy. It feels repressed.

Sitting in a train is not too different from sitting in a cafe, sipping a coffee, reading or listening to a book, working on your laptop or just looking at the world go by. Location is vital. The difference with a train, is that you see many different scenes, sometimes moving; sometimes still (like railway stations, or some faraway vista that lies motionless). Already I feel that this trip and the "concept" I'm trying out is a good idea.

With so many trains to take and so many tickets to keep track of, I've devised a scheme to make sure I remember where everything is. Phone in left front pocket. Wallet and ticket in right front pocket. Any old tickets in back pockets.

A strange thought. If a colourful and controversial work colleague or friend decides to write an autobiography, and has nothing to say about me, should I be "disappointed, but relieved" or "relieved, but disappointed"?

We pass Liege. This part of Belgium was home to my favourite Belgian, Hercule Poirot. I knew all types of things about Liege from how they cook rabbits, to how they speak French. A couple of weeks ago, I was discussing the topic of "what it means to be Indian" with an Indian friend, and how it seems very different from "what it means to be a Sri Lankan". I've been very confused about "what it means to be Belgian". Half Dutch, half French, united vaguely by the Catholic Religion. Compared to last time, when I alighted the train and visited Liege, I see a lot more people out of the train window.

The smoked chicken sandwich from the on-board restaurant is good. Sun-dried tomatoes, smoked chicken, chicken sausage, and cream cheese. Train food is so much better than Plane food.

I'm listening to Kemph's Well Tempered Clavier. It's in shuffle mode, so sometimes I here fugues follow fugues. I also downloaded a couple of audiobooks for this trip, along with the economist. We are in Germany. I know because we see a lot of German flags. Not unlike the US. We pass a stream, with a wigwam on its banks. Parts feel like winter, parts spring, parts even summer as the sun comes out. Rural gives way to Urban.

Many of the houses we pass look like pictures from a "history of music" with a caption, "Bach lived here". I'm tempted to take pictures, but I remember the "rules". Anyway, it's really hard to put my thoughts into a photograph. The houses are ordered, but beautiful. Lots of colours. And lots of foliage surrounding them. Some of the houses are gabled. German architecture seems far less ornate than English. Mostly clean and simple shapes.

Even the "mass produced" blocks of flats look aesthetic. The lone instance of graffiti is a portrait of Calvin (As in Hobbes, not John). "Je suis Charlie" on a roof. Urban gives way to Industrial.

Huge chimneys. Lots of solar panels. Wind turbines. Our speed? 250 kmph.

It costs one Euro to use the WC at Koln Haupt Barnhof. The facilities are spotless.

### 3. Cologne to Koblenz (118 km at 133 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Og4jkARYm_sHXOj5)

As I wait for the Rhine Express to Koblenz, passengers board the TGV to Paris Nord.

There's something about trains that make me proud. All that marvellous engineering that has gone into building trains and railways. And the economic, social and political change this has driven.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OHJiZneEFGnvEUrh)

In "Towards the Flame" (one of my audiobooks for this trip), Dominic Lieven talks about how the age of naval supremacy gave way to the age of railway supremacy.

There's also something noble about trains in a socialist way. Trains serve everyone, from the poorest of the poor crammed into ancient masses to corroding iron in rural India, to the most plush first class carriages. Most rail systems are state owned. And don't seem to have succumbed to vulture capitalism. No chance of a pre-departure video with a cheap CEO telling you how much he cares about you, just before they stop the free TV channels, and move to pay-for-view mode.

We are to pass the birthplace of Beethoven. It's easy to remember "Beethoven was Bonn in Bonn" (pun intended). It's hard not to feel proud of being human, when you know that Beethoven is a member of your species. The Eroica thunders in my earphones in his honour.

I think to myself, should I see Beethoven's birthplace in person on foot, instead of from the distance on a train?

This is a different way of experiencing. Are things better when more things are left to your imagination?

Lawns or beds with a small number of very colourful flowers, usually red or yellow, are very common. Matching the German flag. Even the cemeteries have, not lilies, but these colourful flowers. Lakes, with men fishing. It all feels very peaceful. Unsurprisingly, many passengers dose off. The passenger opposite me is dressed in black. Trousers, shirt, sweater, and coat on the hanger. He's earnestly typing on his laptop. I just notice his dog-collar.

We stop at Bonn. I'm tempted to get off, at least take some pictures. But something reminds me of the rules. As if to confirm this seriousness, the first movement of Beethoven's third, leads to Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D. Shuffle mode. Old Bonn leads to new Bonn. Tech. Factories.

The first mountains appear. And the rhine. Old houses, smokey, with dark window frames, very square. White specs of flowers on green grass. The Rhine is wide; about 80% of my view. The train skirts one of its shores. On the other side houses where Schumann might have lived and written something. Small shops that specialise in selling various things; I don't know what. I seem to be the only "Tourist" on the train; O ye queuing up at Disneyland, o what you miss. Nor have I seen a MacDonalds for quite a while. Barges and boats pass us by. Some shaped like submarines. All sporting the flags of countries, cities, provinces, duchies.

Bad Bresig was painted with the same palette as Nuwara-Eliya. Clouds cool; Grass cold; Houses and flowers warm. We depart from Bad Bresig station, gradually gaining speed in time with La Traviata (the Overture).

Is it just me, or do trains seem to go well with most music?

Fields of small yellow flowers; seemingly endless. The Blue-green scenery reminds me of home. Photos would not have done these justice. If you don't believe me, all I can say is, "come see and be enlightened". Also, I see more. I notice more. I enjoy more. The priest gets off at Andernach. I continue to type with thumbs. As we draw near to Koblenz, the Economist explains the drawbacks of gross-national-product. As I get up, a girl points out that I should get off Koblenz HB, and probably not Koblenz Stadtmitte. She's right. [This proved to be a pattern. I had picked rail routes where tourists, much less a Sri Lankan one, were not common. And various nice locals were quick to help, from interpreting foreign signs, to differentiate between Swiss Francs and Euros]

### 4. Rhine Valley Line: Koblenz to Mannheim (149 km at 95 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bYQIGC-5ekytSLBu)

An old castle looks down at Koblenz station. It's surrounding neighbourhood seems to be mostly populated by "immigrants". However, if a German lived in Syria, Palestine, or wherever these people came from, she would have been known as an "Expat". A Billboard says "My first love". Many billboards seem to have the title in English, but the details in German.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OgXkGYqjxQo6psBY)

Back at Koblenz station after a short walk, I try out a pastry with cheese and chopped bacon.

As we restart our journey along the Rhine, castles get older and more imposing. The river is so wide it looks more like a lake — not unlike Interlaken; with a few differences. The water is dark green, not blue. The hills are hills; not mountains. The greenery is almost Irish in lushness. A medieval tower jumps out of nowhere.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*268rhLOh-NFZY9eA)

Churches, houses, all ornate, noble, and very German. The sort of churches and houses Brahms might have written. There is unmistakable Ottoman influence. I decide to skip the Bruckner until tomorrow, when I'll be in Austria.

After Mainz the scenary is a lot more industrial, and less interesting. The terraine is also dry, with lots of shrub jungle.

On a hilltop flies the German flag, and slightly behind and above it, the EU flag. Some sort of sign? My transit in Mannheim was not long, but I had time to try out a Wiener Mandelhomie; a chocolate coated almond bread.

### 5. Mannheim to Offenburg (141 km at 165 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hT0zNyw6VsU_IHow)

I'm reminded of Karlsruhe Gardens, Colombo, as we pass Karlsruhe. The sun is shining bright, and the odd garden sports a sunbather. The industrial scenery continues, only to give away to more mountains, right at the end, as we approach Offenburg.

### 6. Blackforest Line: Offenburg to Konstanz (152 km at 67 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JnNH57UA0Yge3FyU)

As we leave Offenburg, the first snow-capped mountains begin to appear. We pass idyllic towns, parks, more and more water. The odd beer factory. For some reason all this seems to merge into nature, rather than disrupt it. We pass one old farm, with moss on the roof.

Small square windows, and a bridge over a brook. The setting sun shines golden on the trees and logs. The Blackforest, in contrast, is dark; with rocks, tunnels and shadows. Meadows dressed in long grass and yellow flowers. Lakes, parks and the promise of holidays.

Konstanz is so close to the Swiss border, that the inhabitants fooled WW2 bombers from bombing it, by keeping the lights on during night, thus making it seems like part of Switzerland.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Pl49haIidvBq1ZqJ)

The bridge that joins the two parts of Konstanz is amazing. On one side is the Rhine, on the other side, a much wider lake, that is also the Rhine. It feels the train is floating in the water. The sun is setting on the wider side, and for some reason looks more like a sunrise. I'm not sure of the physics of this, or even whether a sunrise should look different from a sunset.

## April 30th (Day 2–664km, 5 trains)

### 7. Konstanz to Zurich, Switzerland (70 km at 54 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*URMSMSPkCuGf80jP)

Sunrises remind one of other sunrises. The hotel restaurant as a very ornate roof. German sausages, though not spicy, have a lot of interesting herb and fruit flavours. I can see the station clock through the window to my right. For some reason, this feels more reassuring that looking at my phone. Lots of time before I catch the 7.03 to Zurich.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3pjuT9fuCZQqm2If)

As with all the trains yesterday (no train was late arriving, or left more than 1 minute late), my train is sharp on time.

Another thing I love about trains. You get in at a specified time, spend a specified time on the train, and get off at another specified time. Everything very specific. Contrast this with car travel where you have a combination of too much control and too little (e.g. unexpected traffic jams), or plane travel.

Freedom is often the same as giving up control. Beyond looking at some amazing scenary, listening or reading a small set of books, or just thinking, there's little I can do. And this is so freeing.

We slide through tiny farms with sheep. Reminds me of a toy model for some reason. In between, are houses which look very modern and European. Lots of wood, and large windows. The first of our snow covered mountains appear. I loved Zurich on my last trip. This time is no different. It's another bright sunny day.

### 8. Arlberg Line: Zurich to Innsbruck, Austria (286 km at 80 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*E_TM3HgvS6Ebu74O)

As my destination is Austria via Liechtenstein, the music is courtesy of Bruckner.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*94XLawlUGFLFMYh-)

The sunlight on the shores of Lake Zurich is almost blinding. The lake itself is like a solid marble floor. The water in the lakes and streams are not black or brown, but a blue green. This is probably due to light coloured bed rock. Seeing people have fun (fish, camp, walk, run, laugh) while enjoying nature, enhances that enjoyment; recursively.

Bludenz, and the beginning of the famous Arlberg Line. We pass houses, villages and churches of ordinary people; ordinary, but stunningly picturesque. The trees are getting taller, and the foliage thicker. More snow-capped mountains, and lines of frozen rivers. The trees and the soil gets dryer.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rOKdPPqY282ap0st)

I have about an hour to spend in Innsbruck, and I do a walk from the Barnhof to the river, passing a couple of historical sites. A Schnitzel burger makes a good lunch on the move. It's off season, and the town is quiet. I didn't like Vienna much, and nor did I really like

### 9. Innsbruck, Austria to Sargans, Switzerland (194 km at 73 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*x6xR3sXYts-eDXt9)

Back the way we came. Adding details to this diary.

### 10. Sargans to Chur (28 km at 84 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pvDyXoY3i8fHiX9f)

There is a certain introverted peacefulness that only being surrounded by high mountains can create. More turquoise water.

### 11. Bernina Express: Chur to St. Moritz (86 km at 41 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hx4vQigRWvI5yRyl)

The approach to Bergun is stunning. A village with a church, and Piz Ela in the background.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fTUpsDlF1qwwo10F)

Multiple viaducts, some with arched bridges. Loops and hairpin bends. The first signs of ice on the road. Still, lots of bright sunshine. The streams are now black — not unlike Scotland. Streams of melting water flows through the snow.

Preda. The mountains are like Yosemite. Bever. Another small village with green grass and white flowers. Houses have some strage white notation on the walls. Cross between ancient and mathematical (lots of years, and other numbers). Samedan. Fancy modern houses — likely holiday homes. Lots of wood, solar panels, but seem to fit in perfectly into the surroundings.

Like Innsbruck, St. Moritz is deserted. The walk from the Barnhof to the hotel up the hill is quite strenuous, especially after a long day, and at 6000 feet. The view of the lake is stunning though.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hzCMuWhGk6J6HbYx)

Excellent minestrone for dinner. Forgot to bring a Switzerland compatible charger, so end up charging phone with laptop. Realise that I'll have the same problem tomorrow night in Domodossola (Italy, which has yet another plug-point standard).

## May 1st (Day 3–378 km, 5 trains)

### 12. Bernina Express, continued: St. Moritz to Tirano, Italy (57 km at 21 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wtWsZl48FidbbHGk)

St. Moritz is white. It has snowed overnight. And it's still snowing.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FOh4nW1yBhPjkrYT)

Love the Italian breakfast. What a tiny plate of bacon and scrambled eggs. Time and time again, quality trumps quantity.

I walk back downhill to the station, with the snow pinching my face. This time my train is a bit later, 7.48; still, quite early. Bought Swiss variation on a croissant ("Lindel" something). More buttery and less flaky. Continue to love this "station food".

The train is climbing steadily. The "train" is actually four engines connected together. I see the speedometer in the engine compartment in front of me ranging from 20 to 50 kmph. As we will soon be in Italy, the soundtrack is La Boheme.

The surroundings are complete covered with snow; a different type of beauty. I wonder if it would be necessarily better, if it hadn't. Everything is one of three colours: White snow, Black Tree Barks, or Dark Grey waters flowing through the snow.

Piz Bernina from Bernina Diavolezza. Osprizio Bernina, 2244m and the highest point on this journey.

We gradually begin our descent. Gradually, the scenery gets lets white and more green. I'm not sure if this grass is natural, or has been cultivate to prevent erosion; it looks so "manicured".

Miralago. "Mirror Lake". Not exactly like a mirror today; probably due to the direction of the sunlight.

The Brusio loop reminds me of the Demodara loop which I experienced more than 20 years ago en-route from Ella to Badulla.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vhmKOfiw7JB8G0eF)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*M38WdpTlspwgTJCs)

Tirano. My first time in Italy. Visit the Tirano Basilica. Reminds me of Nuwara-eliya. Cars parked in driveways.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*l4Dl_iYOwHcodDmG)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xlCP8sGTljvOrpjj)

### 13. Tirano to Monza (147 km at 64 kmph)

Monza is a bit run down — and the light drizzle adds to this effect. I have about an hour to wonder around, so I visit the Douma and the town square. Lunch is three delicious Italian pastries: A small eclaire — the chocolate filling is like a mouse, the topping is hard; a small pear shape cake dipped in an orange liquare, and a cream horn filled with fresh custard. This, washed down with thick hot chocolate and hazelnut and chocolate ice cream.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SHj-pSfnVWWqI_ag)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sObQ-nL7VZ18sgsf)

### 14. Monza to Bellinzona, Switzerland (101 km at 74 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1UUzY3o9H3afTOYH)

Lecco. Lugano and then Bellinzona. We pass chocolate factories and the odd green house.

### 15. Bellinzona to Locarno (25 km at 62 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*neS7kYJvgxhyUV2d)

The train to Milan, which happens take the same platform as the train to Locarno, is delayed. As a result, the platform is changed for the Locarno train. This is announced in Italian and German — which I don't comprehend. Luckily, I see a train marked "Locarno 4.30" on the opposite platform, so I make a dash, up the overhead bridge and down to the other platform, and into the train. Moments later the doors lock. I feared this would happen far more often on my trip — thankfully this was the only once.

Locarno is like Lugano. Relaxing, but not inspiring. Common to tourist resorts, I suppose. It did not have the ideas of London, the freedom of Amsterdam, or the culture of Paris.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7i3evRcVHXwp1Or0)

### 16. Centavalli Express: Locarno to Domodossola, Italy (48 km at 27 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cBLJFdnX-Du7oUbZ)

The Centavalli (100 Valleys) Express is a small train, more like a light rail. It keeps to about 30 kmph as it winds around the valleys and mountains. Houses spec these huge boulders of rock, which are richly gardened with foliage. Emerald lakes and waterfalls to their sides.

Toot, toot (The train actually has an old-fashioned whistle, that the driver pulls from time to time).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*t31e2xyBB8N1YZ1e)

We pass a field, oddly populated with deer, and...geese. Hotel Eurosola is interesting. While the rooms have been newly fitted with modern accessories. It is nothing fancy.

Photos on walls indicate that this has been a stopping point probably on the way to Brig or Locarno for film stars and other famous people. Perhaps in another era. More photos of Berlusconi and an assortment of shady mafia types (in shades), indicate a shadier past.

No one speaks English. I'm thankful for my smattering of Italian musical terms.

## May 2nd (Day 4–1184 km, 3 trains)

### 17. Domodossola to Lausanne, Switzerland (210 km at 110 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tlm0HBG9RimHlwCC)

Final day. Unlike Saturday and Sunday, my train doesn't leave until nearly 10am. Note for the future: This is a good idea. While the early train rides paid off in terms of more time, and beautiful scenery, I could have done with an hour or two of extra sleep the previous two nights.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-s-3QSMuElt3rdKb)

Outside the station, a throng of small children speaking in Italian reminds me of La vita e bella.

The plates, cups and saucers are of multiple colours — yet they are not gaudy.

Outside the station, a throng of small children speaking in Italian reminds me of La vita e bella.

There is radio music playing in the railway station. There is a certain chaos. A chaos which order admires and envies.

On to Lausanne. The last two acts of La Boheme. Puccini and the surrounding countryside have a lot in common.

Montreux and Lausanne look a lot like Locarno or Lugano, with the exception of the French architecture and signage. Lake Geneva is enormous, blue and beautiful. Reminds me of the see in Hawaii. So still and smooth.

### 18. Laussane to Paris, France (517 km at 141 kmph)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*t4z5bIsjBADDYZQ6)

I have about 2 hours to kill in Paris — so I decide to walk from the Gare du Lyon, along the Seine, through Notre Damme and the Louvre to the Gare du Nord.

And off to Paris. My first ride on a TGV. The top speed of 300kmph was a bit underwhelming. 300 is not much different from 200. But the French countryside was pleasant, sunny, and the food on the train was good. We pass cows and Dijon.

I have about 2 hours to kill in Paris — so I decide to walk from the Gare du Lyon, along the Seine, through Notre Damme and the Louvre to the Gare du Nord. I get there an hour early, but there is a long line.

### 19. Paris to London (457 km at 174 kmph)

It's the last day of a bank holiday long-weekend in the UK, and the check-in line for the Eurostar is the longest I've seen. The train is held 22 minutes, so that all the passengers have time to go through customers, security and board the train. Thankfully, this last train is the only train out of so 19 this long weekend, that is not on time. Had any been delayed, this vacation would have been seriously disrupted.

London St. Pancras, the short walk to Kings Cross, the Circle Line back to Baker Street, and the walk home.

## Epilogue

One of the Audio Books I listened to on this trip was Mindfulness: The Eight-Week Meditation Programme for a Frantic World. This is a quote from that book, quoting a poem by Roger Keyes.

"Hokusai says look carefully. He says pay attention, notice. He says keep looking, stay curious. He says there is no end to seeing..."

# From "Immersion" to "Emergence"

### On Data Science Blogs, Writing and Peter Thiel

## Data Science Blogs

How do you write a good data science blog?

I used to think that "every good data science blog, starts with a good data science question". For example, I started "On Floating Voters" with a question. "What proportion of Sri Lankan voters are floating voters"? And the rest of the blog was about answering that "good" question.

But this is not entirely true. That's not quite how that blog began. It had far more humble origins.

It began when I got my hands on some data related to elections. I started "playing about" with the data. First on a spreadsheet, then with Python. And then by creating some charts and visualisations. In this way, I "immersed" myself in various pieces of data related to the elections. And the question about floating voters "emerged".

## Writing

There is a problem with "good questions that everyone knows". They belong to one of two types. Either they are "good questions, to which a good answer is impossible". Like "is there a safe and cheap way to perform fusion reactions". They don't have good answers. Or else they are actually "bad questions, disguised as good ones".

Hence, the only way to find good questions is to find good questions that no one knows. The problem with this is that "you" are part of "everyone". So, you also don't know. But that's the idea. You look for questions that you don't know.

How do you do that? You immerse yourself in as much data. Books, pictures, movies, songs. Whatever it takes. And a "good question" will emerge.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5bLiEoziFQhmzxLG-23wtQ.png)

What information that one consumes consciously, one digests subconsciously. Not necessarily happen in "real-time". The subconscious is generally slow and takes time. That is why you get up in the morning and suddenly find that you have a great idea. On a side note, if you want to have good ideas, or "be creative", make sure you get plenty of sleep.

This "immersion" to "emergence" process is not unique to Data Science Blog Writing. It is how all great works of writing emerge. One immerses oneself, and great work will emerge. The poem will write the poem. The novel will write the novel. The writing will write the writing.

## Peter Thiel

How do you come up with that killer startup idea? The "next Google"?

In Zero-To-One, Peter Thiel talks about Indian Restaurants in Silicon Valley. And how most of them fail. Founders assume that people are asking "How do I find great Indian food?". When people are actually asking "How do I find good Indian good, across the dozens of potentially crappy Indian Restaurants across Silicon Valley?"

Thiel asks "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" Or to re-phrase "To what good question do you have a good answer, which no one else knows?"

So how do you find a good question that no one else knows?

Startups rarely start with the right "good question". Instead, they start with something, iterate, and something emerges. Hence, startups also follow an "immerse" and "emerge" tactic. The best startups are not the ones with the best idea. They are the ones that are most efficient at making a good idea "emerge". That's why the personalities of founders are far more critical than "the idea".

Hence, data science blogs, writing and startups are all the same. To be successful, you need to immerse, and something good will emerge.

# Burgher Beauties

### What Data Science says about Miss World

Caroline Jurie became the second Sri Lankan to win the Mrs. World Pageant; the first being Rosy Senanayake, who won the inaugural competition in 1984. With six, the United States has the most number of wins by country. Followed by Russia, Peru and Sri Lanka, which have two wins each.

Thisuri Wanniarachchi made an interesting (and somewhat contraversial) tweet about how an Euro-centric standard of beauty might disproportionately influence Miss World (and other beauty pageants). And, for this reason, the (apparent) increased likelihood of Sri Lankan Burgher women to perform well in such competitions.

>>> 

There seemed to be some truth to this claim. Afterall, both Jurie and Senanayake had Burgher heritage. But I was curious as to "how true" this was. Could we answer this question data scientifically?

Was a Data-Driven answer to the question, "What types of Sri Lankan women do well at international beauty pageants?"

## Last Names

One method would be to analyse the last names (surnames) of contestants. See who had Sinhala names, and Tamil names, and Moor or Malay names. And Burgher names.

But there was an obvious problem with this approach. We use a male-parent-centricnaming convention.

For example, I share my last name Senaratna (සේනාරත්න) with my father, but not with my mother. And with my paternal-grandfather, but not my other three grandparents. And with my father's father's father, but not my other seven great-grandparents. Even if all these ancestors with whom I don't share a name, were Burgher, I would not have a Burgher name.

Hence, last names were a dead-end.

## Background Research

We could interview the contestants or do some online research on them. And try to find more details about their ancestry. Possible, but expensive. And even if we do that, there is no guarantee of accurate data.

Another dead-end.

## Genetic Information

The perfect "source-of-truth" would be genetic information. If we analysed the DNA of each contestant, we could find out what their ancestry would have been like. Particularly who had European genes.

For example, according to 23andMe, my ancestry is 78.2% Sri Lankan, 6.2% North-East Indian, 3.6% Southern Indian, and 4.2% Central Asian. Hence, my genes were mostly South-Asian with a bit of Central Asian.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*29rqiLsO0vSWAG0Xv4NGaQ.png)

Unfortunately, I had neither the time nor the resources to ask every Miss/Mrs. Sri Lanka for a saliva sample. So that I could do some DNA analysis.

So, yet another dead-end.

## Faces

Then I thought, "What about Faces?"

Can we do some data analysis on pictures of beauty pageant contestants? And "see what they look like?"

And was there some unbiased way of doing this? There was!

What if we asked a Face Recognition system to cluster images using the same criteria as used to recognise faces?

That would work.

## Parenthesis: How Face Recognition Works

Before we address our question, let's see how Face Recognition works.

Let's start with a photo. Say, 2018 Miss Sri Lanka winner, Nadia Gyi.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NbO5kTi0-KEusrYbLEMbKg.png)

The Face Recognition system starts with Face "Detection". I.e. find the portion of the photo that is "the face". Something like:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qt5QEZXImaywU3ICOviZEw.png)

Next, the system detects various parts of the face. Like lips, chin, eyes, nose etc. It stores the coordinates of these parts.

```
[{'chin': [[81, 178], [81, 195], [84, 213], [93, 232], [102, 248], [113, 264], [125, 280], [137, 294], [154, 298], [175, 293], [198, 283], [221, 268], [241, 250], [254, 228], [260, 202], [259, 174], [257, 147]],
```

```
'left_eyebrow': [[76, 146], [82, 140], [91, 140], [102, 142], [112, 146]], 'right_eyebrow': [[139, 141], [155, 133], [172, 127], [191, 126], [210, 130]],
```

```
'nose_bridge': [[128, 165], [127, 179], [125, 194], [124, 208]],
```

```
'nose_tip': [[120, 219], [126, 222], [132, 223], [140, 220], [149, 217]],
```

```
'left_eye': [[91, 174], [96, 172], [105, 170], [116, 171], [106, 176], [97, 177]],
```

```
'right_eye': [[158, 165], [166, 162], [177, 161], [190, 160], [178, 166], [168, 167]],
```

```
'top_lip': [[120, 246], [123, 242], [130, 238], [136, 240], [141, 237], [157, 240], [176, 241], [170, 243], [143, 246], [137, 247], [132, 247], [124, 247]],
```

```
'bottom_lip': [[176, 241], [160, 255], [146, 261], [140, 262], [133, 261], [126, 256], [120, 246], [124, 247], [132, 247], [138, 248], [143, 247], [170, 243]]}]
```

Finally, the system converts these measurements into a "numerical signature" which is representative of the face.

```
[0.026797764003276825, 0.08502992987632751, 0.04182086139917374, -0.19603687524795532, -0.15643954277038574, -0.07881894707679749, -0.07458163797855377, -0.07068698108196259, 0.1689264476299286, -0.15674743056297302, 0.18560218811035156, -0.06397917866706848, -0.14878053963184357,...]
```

The signature consists of a list of numbers that represent various complex ratios of face parts which are deemed to be "most representative" of the particular face, based on millions of examples. Note, since these are ratios, putting on make-up or wearing a hat or glasses won't change the signature. Only complex plastic surgery could change the ratio of (say) the length of your nose to the width of your lips.

## Test Run

We can cluster beauty pageant contestant, by grouping candidates with similar "face signatures". But before we do actual clustering, let's test the system.

I took face photos of the. 2019 Miss Sri Lanka Dewmi Thathsarani, and 2018 Miss World winner Vanessa Ponce, and "asked" our Face Recognition system to cluster the images.

If it works properly, one cluster should only contain pictures of Thathsarani. The other only those of Ponce.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9Obs1Tv5yq45W2lq1upnCg.png)

And it works! So far so good.

## Actual Run

I scraped the web for pics of Miss Sri Lanka and Miss World winners since 2000, and used my Face Recognition system into five groups.

(Note, I used Miss, instead of Mrs., because more face photos were available of the former online)

Let's see what the five clusters looked like.

### Cluster 1 — "Sri Lanka"

The first cluster consists of only Miss Sri Lanka winners (indicated by the red border).

Each cluster has some "Archetype Face" or "Mean Face" and candidates are sorted in order of the "difference" or distance from this face. The faces at the top are more similar to the cluster mean.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jYAlYq_hfe4DIim8wkWW6Q.png)

(For clarity, I haven't displayed all the candidates in the cluster)

### Cluster 2 — "European"

The second cluster consists of only Miss World winners (indicated by the blue border) and is dominated by very "European" looking faces. Most of the candidates also have light hair.

Though our Face Recognition system, which is "colour blind" disregards colors, the "color" of a person is obvious correlated with face ratios.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XUKPQGPD4DdHI3VuPZRI6A.png)

### Cluster 3 — "Asian"

The third cluster is dominated by South, Central and East Asian Miss World winners, and one Miss Sri Lanka (at some distance from the Cluster Mean).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gg091rOGdLaRr5ZUtg6fhA.png)

### Cluster 4 — "International"

The fourth cluster has Miss Worlds from multiple continents. Who are surprisingly similar in some ways (e.g. Noses).

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x6L-BzW53BkxrG8VtL7XMw.png)

### Cluster 5 — Sri Lanka 2

The final cluster consists of only Miss Sri Lankas. Who differ somewhat from Cluster 1.

(A friend implied that Cluster 5 looks more Sri Lankan than Cluster 1. She might very well think that, but the data can't possibly comment.)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n7kV4zvK2qS5ohHFjf_DEw.png)

## Bad News, and Good News

Since our system only compares faces and knows nothing of ancestry, we can't judge Thisuri's "Burgher Heritage" point.

However, we have to agree with Thisuri that a significant portion of Miss Worlds (Cluster 2) have very "Euro-Centric" features.

Still, the world seems to be changing. Asia, in particular, is rising. A lot of Miss Worlds are likely to be South, Central and East Asian in the future. Like Cluster 3.

Sadly, there is bad news for Sri Lanka. There was minimal similarity between the Miss Sri Lanka faces, and the Miss World faces. Note how little clusters 2, 3 and 4, overlapped with 1 and 5. For some reason, despite being clearly very beautiful, Miss Sri Lankas don't "look like" Miss Worlds. Since this applies to all Sri Lankans, this must also apply to Sri Lankan Burghers. If Mrs. World is anything like Miss World, the Jurie and Senanayaka wins seem to be Black Swans.

Overall, one characteristic that all the clusters seem to have is some "sameness". Everyone seems to look the "same" in many ways, which implies that beauty pageants might be converging to some (if not necessarily European) narrow standard of beauty.

Hence, I tend to agree with Thisuri's final point. Why do women have to get up on stage and be judged? On some narrow set of standards? There are better things to do.

For example, Sri Lanka has a severe shortage of Computer Scientists and Data Scientists. And an even more severe shortage of female CSs and DSs. Why not adopt one of these professions? Using fancy Face Recognition to cluster the faces of beauties might be almost as fun as being one.

# Voting on Truth

### Politicians, Deep Fakes and Blockchain

## Deep Fakes and Kissing Kiddies

What if a video circulates "the internets". Where a prominent and powerful politician Hon. Loku Banda confesses to a callous and cadaverous crime. And many people believe it to be true.

Soon enough, though, Hon. Loku Banda's supporters claim that the video is a "Deep Fake". And they propagate another video. The "original". Where said Hon. Loku Banda confesses, not to a callous and cadaverous crime. But to kissing kiddies and handling hands.

Which is true? The "fake" or the "original"?

Loku Banda is popular. Half the populace support him. And this half believe the "original" to be true.

You, dear reader, on the other hand, sceptical and discerning, are slow. To jump to conclusions. The "fake" could be true. Or the "original" could be true. Or neither could be true. There is no evidence. One way or the other.

All your friends (the few people you trust) agree with you. And so you adopt agnosticism.

## Relative and Absolute Truth

"1 + 1 = 2" is true. By definition. Because in modern mathematics "the definition of 2" is "that which is 1 + 1".

But there are very few absolutely true things, like "1 + 1 = 2".

Most things are true, on condition that other things are true. "Politician Hon. Loku Banda (LB) is honest" depends on "My friend believes that the Hon. LB is honest". And "I believe that my friend is honest" and "My beliefs are reasonable".

Even truths like "It is raining outside" might depend on "I can see outside" and "I can see that it is raining". And "I'm not hallucinating, and I can trust my senses".

Hence, most things we believe true are relative. Dependent on other truths. Which might not be true. As a result, many people may believe many different (and often contradictory) relative truths.

This is not always a problem. After all, most people might disagree on truths like "the true religion", "the true political or economic system" or the "true way to make bread pudding". Christianity is as true for a true Christian, as Capitalism is true for a true Capitalist.

## Truth by Vote

But sometimes we need a unified version of truth.

What if prominent and powerful Loku Banda is summoned to court. For committing the callous and cadaverous crime. How would the "fake" and "original" videos feature as evidence?

The judiciary would apply some process. To either side with one of the videos, or dismiss both. Either way, the process would "vote" on the videos.

Blockchains also work on this idea. A group of entities that don't necessarily trust each other maintain a shared ledger of data, which they mutually trust to be true. The system "works", as long as at least half the entities are "honest".

But can truth, like blockchain, be decided by vote?

Intuitively, there is something deeply unpleasant about this. To me. Perhaps to you, also.

## The Nature of Truth

But what is truth? Most dictionaries define "true" or "truth" in relation to reality. That which is "true" is that which is "real". Consistent with reality.

But reality is subjective. Dependent on each observer. Each of us see our own version of reality. We can discuss our realities with each other. But we can't truly experience the reality of another. And we can't judge the "trueness" or the "realness" of these "other realities" .

We might judge the reality of another. We might complain that "Common-man Punchi Singno is gullible". Or that "Common-man Punchi Singno trusts Politician Loku Banda too much". But in the end, these judgements are relative to our own.

So, the nature of truth seems highly individual and decentralised. And "voting" on truth might not be unreasonable as it seems.

The "unpleasantness" I felt might stem from my own prejudice. "My truth is more true than everyone else's truth". But everyone else also believes this. And voting breaks any ties.

# The Polymath, the Rebel, the Woman and the Misfit

### "Factional" reflections on our education system

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KdQZkrDkHOfSMavav6iw9g.jpeg)

The new government is reviewing university admissions, apparently. And the criteria for evaluating A.Level results.

>>> 

This got me thinking. About education in general. The strengths and weaknesses of our system.

Rather than spelling out my thoughts (literally), I thought it fun to explain my ideas through four "factional" characters. Four people for whom our education system has not been optimal.

## The Polymath

"We'll need to move", said Grand-uncle Ayoub. Mock-ruefully. A disaster, indeed. Ayesha had devoured every single book in their small village library. Itself being small and perched on a small strip of land. That parted the Batticaloa lagoon and the vast Bay of Bengal.

That didn't stop our ten-year-old from visiting a nearby village, and borrowing from friends. She loved the lyricism and curve of the Sinhala language. Especially the novels and the poems.

Sinhala was her first love. But Ayesha was no one-trick filly. One day, she said, she will win a Nobel Prize. Not in literature. But in Economics. So when it was time to pick her A. Level subjects, no one was surprised when she chose Sinhala and Economics. Her third choice was, however, problematic.

She was determined to study Mathematics. But her school, like many in the country, didn't offer "science" subjects. Happily, there was a solution. The "boys school" next-door, did offer "Combined Maths" for the A. Levels. And so Ayesha and her father visited the principal.

It was a bit unusual. But, technically, not against regulations. So, four times a week, a girl in a Hijab sat at the front of the class. During Maths lessons at the school next door.

But grand-uncle Ayoub lamented. Being so smart, Ayesha could have been an "IT Man". Or even an "Engine". But with just one "Maths" subject, few of the local universities would have let her in. So what was she to do?

Thankfully, this was not a problem for Ayesha. She had already applied to several colleges in the United States. And half a dozen had accepted her.

Our lover of Sinhala and avid reader, commenced her undergraduate studies in a middle-tier university somewhere in the mid-west of America. With a "full-ride". After two years, she got a transfer. To the Ivy League.

The last time I checked, Ayesha was in a quandary. She had applied to the eight best PhD programs in Behavioural Economics. Worldwide. And had got accepted to all eight. With funding.

Was it going to be Cambridge, Massachusetts or Cambridge, England, or some other "Cambridge"?

## The Rebel

Bala left home at the age of four. Armed only with a small back-pack and a blue and green bottle of water. He was going to "shrek his fortunes". (He knew a lot of "big words")

Happily or unhappily, he was seen by a horrified Aunt Selvi. Attempting a crossing of the mighty Galle Road. He was summarily picked up and deposited back at the family home in Wellawatta.

Bala built his first radio at the age of eight. His first synthesizer at 12. At 16, he wrote his own operating system, claiming that memory management in Linux, was "full of crap".

His parents might have been pleased. But they were not.

Young Bala, failed, not one subject, but all eight subjects at his O.Levels. "I thought he was a smart kid", said Aunt Selvi (on a brief visit back from Montreal). In reality, Bala used to sit at the back of the class. And dream of his latest idea. To split processor threads, or multiplex his data bus.

By the time I interviewed Bala for a Software Engineer gig, he had already started a small business. Building websites and other IT odd-jobs. He "failed" the interview, because unlike most "SWEs" he hadn't gone to university. So didn't know the answers to many "well-known" questions.

But I could see Bala was special. Even something of a genius. And so I hired him. I dedicated a few hours per week to tutor Bala on "conventional" Computer Science. He picked up everything in next to no time.

One of the senior tech-leads wants me to fire Bala. Why? Apparently, he "doesn't have a degree". And he's talking on his phone. "In Tamil"

He should have said, "Because he can do my job. And much better."

"And I don't want you to fire me."

## The Woman

At Christmas, Carloboy never bought dolls. With his meagre bonus, as a watcher at HSBC, he'd buy Crystal a toy truck or a train. The first time he'd done so, his daughter had taken it apart. Piece by piece. And put it all back together again. Perfectly.

Crystal had always wanted to make cars. Not ordinary cars. But special cars. Like "that Musk fellow" that Carloboy admired so much.

Old Mr Ramanujan was suspicious. When Crystal chose "Physical Science" for her A.Levels. "Why are all these girls doing Maths? Maths is a man's job".

The nine-teen girls at Old Ramanujan's solitary combined maths class, learnt little Algebra or Calculus. Only Ramanujan's lamentations on the curse of feminism. And the wife that hen-pecked him at home. So, like everyone else, Crystal signed up at the Nugegoda tuition "market". Right next to the actual market. Complete with the perfume of rotting cabbages.

Crystal was an immediate sensation. Or at least not quite her, but her short skirts and beautiful legs. Most of the benches were full of boys. The few girls were "told" to wear denims and over-sized shirts. And were doing their best to merge into the background.

Crystal was both "inappropriate" and no-one could keep their eyes off her. And for some "object" the boys were happy to "look at" so enthusiastically, they couldn't even afford mere politeness. Instead, Crystal was only presented with abuse. Centered on her ethnicity and gender. She was just another "Burgher Bitch". Or its more colourful Sinhala translation.

Today, Crystal is PA to a founder and CEO of a tech startup. She still wants to build cars one day. And perhaps produce her own Tesla. Or maybe Vega. Happily, her boss is supportive. Having jumped many of the hoops that tripped-up Crystal. Herself.

Maybe. Someday.

## The Misfit

Medicine was running in Dan's veins. Not because he was ill. But because his father, grandfather and his father were all famous doctors. An ancestor had been personal physician to Shri Vikrama Rajasinha. The Royal Doc had been renown for treating skin ailments. And had famously cured a particularly nasty boil off the royal posterior. For which he was awarded several thousand acres of land. Known as the "Passa-Yata Korale".

Dan was short for "Dhananjaya". Only his musician friends called him "Dan". Dan had always wanted to be a drummer. But "the family" constantly badgered him against it. "You must be a doctor". "You must be a doctor". That was all that was "drummed" into our drummer.

The family seemed to have a pathological hatred of all things musical. And with good reason. Another ancestor (on Dan's mother's side) had been chief drummer at the Dalada Maaligaava. But this piece of history was hidden. Because drummers were, apparently, "differently-abled". Caste-wise. Worse still, he was "of the low-country". Hence, while Dan inherited his maternal ability and affection to drumming, he inherited his paternal name. And expectations.

Dan passed his A.Levels well enough to "get into" Colombo Medical College. Most medical students faint or are at least queazy at their first dissection. But soon get used to it. Dan had the unique accomplishment of fainting at all. Every single one. And even during clinicals. He couldn't stand the sight of needles or blood.

No one knows how. But amazingly, Dan made it through Medical College. Aunty Selvi claims that it was his father's and uncles' (all all-important Docs) "influence". I don't really know. Whatever happened, Dan became a doctor.

But he never practised as one. He went back to his beloved drumming. And is now part of quite a popular band.

## Concluding Commentary

* Ayesha. Our A. Levels and University system is focussed on a narrow set of disciplines. Ideally, choosing a diverse set of subjects should broaden one's options. In reality, they narrow. Our educational system has no place for generalists. Or polymaths like Ayesha. But other parts of the world are happy to gain our loss.

* Bala. Solving any problem involves exploration and exploitation. A. Levels narrowly exploit a small set of criteria known to correlate somewhat with University performance. Instead, it should have at least a small degree of "exploration". Where Rebels, like Bala, might have some (even slight) chance of admission. The lack of exploration leads to local maxima. Our university graduates probably do a reasonably good job. But we are unlikely to produce genuinely great people. No Einsteins or Teslas.

* Crystal. A. Levels are supposed to be the "great leveller". Whether you are rich or poor, if you get the same mark, you get the same opportunity. Sadly, it is much easier for some people to get "marks" as opposed to others. And anyway, the purpose of public education is not to be fair. It's to produce educated people that the country needs. A system which significantly oppresses half the population is not what the country needs. Nor is it fair.

* Dan. Many people at university don't want to be at university. That is because Sri Lankans have some irrational respect for some fields over others. And a certain narrow definition of "Education" in general. Until there are viable alternatives to "traditional university education", both socially and economically, the university system itself will suffer. Just as many want to be at university. Many don't. And sadly, neither have a choice.

# A Brief History of Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections

### 1989 to 2015

In this article, I review the seven parliamentary elections, held under the proportional representation (PR) system. For context, I begin with a historical prelude.

## Prelude: Before 1989

Sri Lanka's first Parlimentary election was held in 1947. This was followed by '52, '56, March '60, July '60, '65, and '70.

The 8th election should have been held in 1975, given that the previous election was held in 1970. Instead, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike took advantage of the new 1972 constitution. And delayed the vote by two years. To 1977.

### 1977

By '77, the ruling SLFP was deeply unpopular. While "closed" economic policies led to some development of local industry, unemployment was high and essential goods in short supply. The opposition UNP had regrouped after its 1970 defeat and promised opening-up the economy.

The UNP won 50.92% of the vote, and140 of the 168 seats. A 5/6ths majority. While the SLFP won 29.72%, it could manage only 8 seats.

Several Federalist Tamil parties merged to form the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). And won all 14 seats in the Northern Province. And another four seats in the Eastern Province, for a total of 18 seats.

For the first time in history, a Tamil party won the second-highest number of seats. And became the official opposition.

### 1982 Referendum

The 1978 constitution created an executive presidency and expanded parliament to 225 members. It also replaced "first-past-the-post" (FPTP) with proportional representation (PR) in the parliamentary election.

To maintain a parliamentary super-majority, the UNP proposed extending the parliament by six years, to 1989. The 4th amendment was passed in parliament and was then upheld by the supreme court. On condition that it passed a public referendum.

Hence, five years after 1977, a referendum was held on December 22nd, 1982 in place of a general election. 54.66% voted in favour. While 45.34% voted against. Hence, parliament extended to 1989.

## 1989

1989 was the first election help under the new PR system.

The General Election polled amidst chaos. The LTTE waged war in the north and east. The JVP insurrected in many other parts of the country. Turnout was just 63.60%. Down from 70.82% during the 1982 referendum.

The UNP with 50.71%, won a similar share of the vote to 1977. But with the new PR system, won only 125 of 225 seats (55.55%). An absolute majority, but no super-majority.

The SLFP won 31.90% of the vote and 67 seats.

The Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) and TULF, won 13 and 10 seats respectively. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) won 4 seats.

The United Socialist Alliance (comprising of the CP, the LSSP, the NSSP and the SLMP), and the MEP won three seats each.

## 1994

Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's 1994 wins in the general and presidential elections marked the end of 17 years of UNP rule. Years marked by terror, corruption and two civil conflicts. The people demanded change at the ballot box.

The general election was held on August 16th, with a 76.24% turnout. Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's People's Alliance (PA), consisting of the CP, LSSP, SLMP and SLFP, won 48.94% and 105 seats. Eight short of the 113 required for a majority in parliament.

The UNP (which also included the CWC) won 44.04% and 94 seats. The EPDP, TULF and TELO (an alliance of EROS, PLOTE and TELO) won 9, 5 and 3 seats respectively. The SLMC won 7 seats. The JVP and UPFC won a seat each.

Despite no absolute majority, the PA formed a government, helped by EPDP and SLMC support.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TEbatwQCA_q1rxRxIvSQvg.png)

## 2000

The PA government failed to meet expectations. It failed to make peace with the LTTE. The war was as brutal as ever. The hated executive presidency was not abolished. And, perhaps decisively, the economy had ground to a halt.

2000 was one of the most violent of elections. Seventy people were killed, including six on election day, October 10th. The PA was also accused of fraud and intimidation.

A broader PA alliance, which included the SLMC, the MEP, and the CWC (which had previously allied with the UNP) won 45.11% of the vote, and 107 seats. The UNP (including the UPFC) won 40.22% of the vote and 89 seats.

The JVP won 10 seats. The TULF, EPDP, TELO and ACTC won 5, 4, 3 and 1 seat respectively. The SLMC (contesting separately in Digamadulla and Trincomalee) won 4 seats. The new Sihala Urumaya (SU) won 1 seat.

With no majority, parliament was in impasse. Another election followed soon.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rdGWSykItKOumv4XgIW5pQ.png)

## 2001

Elections were held on December 5th, 2001. Just 421 days after the previous general election.

The PA suffered several setbacks in the lead-up to the election. Most of the SLMC left the coalition. 13 SLFP members defected to the UNP. Angered by the parties effort to court the JVP, supposedly.

2001 was as violent as 2000. 46 people were killed in the lead-up to polling day, and another 14 on polling day itself.

The UNF alliance (including the UNP, SLMC, CWC and UPFC) won 45.62% of the vote, and 109 seats. The PA (which now missed the SLMC) won 37.19% and 77 seats.

The JVP won 16 seats. The Tamil National Alliance (consisting of the ACTC, EPRLF, TELO and TULF) won 15 seats. The SLMC (contesting from the UNF in Ampara, Batticaloa and Jaffna) won 5 seats. The EPDP and PLOTE won 2 and 1 seat respectively.

With its SLMC allies, the UNP-led alliance won a paper-thin majority.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0CtJbhl1qmT4JfuGQV1smA.png)

## 2004

A president and prime minister from two different parties led to total disfunction. And hence, parliament dissolved in 2004. And elections were called for April 2nd.

The PA rebranded as the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and was joined by the JVP. It won 45.60% of the vote, and 105 seats.

The UNF won 37.83% and 82 seats.

The TNA won 22 seats. The Sinhala Heritage (Hela Urumaya) party, which had since morphed into the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), with the inclusion of several Buddhist monks as MPs, won 9 seats. The SLMC (contesting separately from the UNF in the Eastern Province and Jaffna) won 5 seats. The EPDP and the UPFC (now separate from the UNF) won a seat each.

Despite lacking a majority, crossovers from several SLMC MPs and the CWC gave the UPFA a working majority.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*j2wsy5ZahaabJ3bUSRtvrw.png)

## 2010

Since 2004, parliament was the stage for multiple crossovers and counter-crossovers. In June 2005, the JVP (consisting of 39 MPs), left the UPFA. In January 2006, 4 UNP MPs joined the UPFA. In January 2007, 18 UNP MPs, 6 SLMC MPs and the JHU joined the UPFA. In December 2007, 4 SLMC MPs quit the UPFA. In December 2008, 12 JVP MPs who'd previously quit the UPFA, rejoined branding themselves as the NFF.

Hence, at most times, the UPFA enjoyed a stable-enough majority in parliament.

As expected, following the conclusion of the 30-year-war in May 2009, and Mahinda Rajapaksas resounding presidential election win on January, the UPFA was expected to win a landslide at the 2010 general election.

The UPFA won a whopping 60.33% of the vote and 144 seats (just six short of a 2/3rds majority). UNF won 29.34% and 60 seats. The TNA won 14 seats. The JVP won 7 seats.

Later that year, with the support of some opposition MPs, the UPFA was able to garner 2/3rds of parliament needed to pass the 18th amendment.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oZkcu-r7bKF143hynPMO2Q.png)

## 2015

Following Maitripala Sirisena's surprise win in the January Presidential Election, his 100-day "reform program" promised to dissolve parliament on April 23rd. In actuality, parliament disbanded in June, and elections were scheduled for August 17th.

The UNP-led UNFGG (United National Front for Good Governance), won 45.66% of the vote and 106 seats. The UPFA 42.38% and 95 seats. The TNA 16 seats. The JVP 6 seats. The SLMC (contesting separate from the UNFGG in Batticaloa and Vanni) and the EPDP won a seat each.

A few days after the election, the SLFP agreed to form a national government with the UNFGG for a period of two years.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ujZRMLpwUtZftunZfmdgNw.png)

## Postlude: 2020

The exact date has not been set for the 2020 election, though it is rumoured to be in March, April or May. Constitutionally it must be held before December 1st, 2020.

If we (hypothetically and unscientifically) assume, that voting at the next general election is similar to the 2019 Presidential Election, and also assign the seats the UNF gains in the Northern Province and the Trincomalee District to the TNA, and those in the Batticaloa District to the SLMC, the "Seats by Party" would be as follows:

# Why Government?

### Reflections on Budgets and Values

This chart shows how our government budgets expenditure.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*M2YiAhPuk3a6hHWoEzIAKw.png)

I was curious. Were these numbers too high or too low? Was all this spending necessary?

It was challenging to get one's head around numbers like 300,000,000,000 (our annual spending on Defence). A zero here or there didn't seem to make much of a difference. So I decided to make two adjustments.

* First, "convert" the numbers to "per person".

* Second, to align things with how most "ordinary" people "budget", convert the numbers to "per month".

Assuming a population of 22,000,000, we get defence spending at Rs. 13,636 per person per year, or about Rs. 1,200 per person per month. Similarly,

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*D8C4Xt0nPchTc6nVZgIFKw.png)

This led to more questions. For example, would I be willing to forgo all the services that the Ministry of Health provided in exchange for Rs. 700 a month? Or stop using transport and highways for Rs. 910?

Was the government doing a good job, or could I pay someone else less and get more value for my money?

Pondering these questions, led to more questions on the "purpose of government".

## Big Government, Small Government

Almost everyone agrees that a country needs a government. But Many disagree, on its nature and size.

At one extreme, Libertarians argue for "Small Government". Where governments are responsible for as little expenditure as possible. At the other extreme, Communists argue for "Big Government". Where all spending is centrally planned and controlled.

Neither extreme seemed idea, so I thought of reasoning about each type of spending. One by one.

## Defence (Rs. 1,200 per month)

Like all things military, Defence is a hierarchical topic. A president of a country is usually also commander-in-chief. Unlike health, finance, or education, Defence is proportional to the size of a nation. A smaller state can be healthier, wealthier and wiser, than a bigger country. But a bigger country is almost always "stronger". Defence-wise.

Hence, in most cases, Defence is centralised. Centralisation is partly due to the need for control. It would be "inconvenient" if the governor of each province had to approve a country's military action. It is also due to some "centralised values". For example, protecting the "sovereignty" of a country is a goal of its defence forces. And sometimes "sovereignty" and decentralisation (e.g. "Federalism") conflict.

Thus, it would be almost impossible to think of Sri Lanka's military organised at a provincial level.

On the other hand, a few countries, like Switzerland, have a relatively decentralised defence system. Cantons have significant powers, especially with important decisions like declaring war. I wonder if more countries had decentralised defence systems, whether there would be fewer wars?

## Health (Rs. 700) and Education (Rs. 700)

Unlike Defence, health and education can be decentralised. There are many private hospitals and schools in the country. However, these are mostly patronised by the wealthy. The majority relies on the state for free healthcare and education.

In theory, the central government could decentralise health and education entirely to local governments. And restrict itself, not to execution, but to only legislation.

In practice, it seems that the government performs a balancing act. Colombo and Moneragala could, in theory, run all their hospitals and schools. But in practice, Colombo has more resources than Moneragala, and hence could probably provide better services. By transferring resources from more affluent areas to poorer ones, the government ensures that everyone has some basic level of healthcare.

The principle or "value" behind this balancing seems to be "All Sri Lankans have the right to some level of healthcare and education". Whether Colombo or Moneragala.

But suppose you are a wealthy person. You can afford private hospitals and schools. Perhaps even international ones. Would you forgo government health and educational services? For Rs. 1,400 per month?

You might want your money back. But it isn't that simple. You benefit indirectly in many other ways. For example, you might employ people who benefit from state education and healthcare. And if the government doesn't ask your neighbour to clear his drains, you might suffer Dengue.

## Highways (Rs. 660) and Transport (Rs. 250)

Most roads are maintained by local authorities, like municipal councils, urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas. If you live on a private road, it's you and your neighbours who do the maintaining.

But what about large projects? Like expressways, new railway systems, and airports?

Highway and Transport Infrastructure and "infrastructure" in general, suffer from a paradox. "Infrastructure" almost always makes a loss in the short-term. Even in the longer-term, it usually makes a "measurable" loss. On the other hand, many believe that its "un-measurable" benefits out-weigh these "measurable" costs. For example, building and maintaining an expressway might cost a government billions. But it might also spur commerce and industry in locations accessible by the highway. And increase the country's productivity as a whole.

## Concluding Questions

I still don't know if I'm paying too much or too little for Defence, health, education, transport, highways, and manifest other things. But I'll continue asking myself the following questions:

* Why does the government provide some service? What values lie behind their various roles?

* Is the government the best party to provide that service?

* If not, who should?

* If so, how might the government do better?

# Asymmetric Democracy

### Trump, Upper Houses and Jaffna

## Impeachment and Trial

The US House of Representatives (the lower house of Congress) voted to impeach President Donald Trump. He will now face a trial in the Senate (the upper house). While the impeachment requires only a simple majority of members of the House of Representatives to pass, conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds super-majority.

Donald Trump would likely be acquited. Because the President's Republican party holds a majority in the Senate, and senators are unlikely to break ranks. I will be surprised if even a simple majority vote to convict the President.

## The Strange Senate

The Democratic Party has more popular support nation-wide than compared to the Republican Party. Then, how does the latter have a majority in the Senate?

This is because the Senate is strange. Each of the 50 United States of America, regardless of population, has two representatives in the Senate, for a total of 100 senators. Hence, California (population almost 40 Million), and Wyoming (550,000) have the same representation.

The rationale behind the allocation was to prevent big states from dominating small states. Also, the Senate was supposed to be a thoughtful and long-termist, compared to the 435 House of Representatives. Representatives of the "House" were elected every two years, in proportion to voter population. They were expected to keep tabs of citizen needs and draft laws. In contrast, the Senate, elected every six years, would validate and, if necessary, dampen the activity of the house. In many cases, the house decided what to do, and the Senate, what not to. Given these roles, asymmetry was not considered problematic. At least to the founding fathers of the US.

And the arrangement seemed to work. At least, in theory. In practice, particularly more recently, the disproportionate nature of the Senate has given the Republican party, which is more popular in smaller states, an advantage. Many have described this asymmetry as undemocratic.

The asymmetry also (to a lesser degree) affects presidential elections. A presidential candidate getting more votes in a state, is assigned all the "Electoral College seats" of that state. The Electoral College currently consists of the 100 senators and the 435 representatives. Hence, the winner of smaller states gets relatively more seats than winners of bigger states.

Many partly blamed Hillary Clinton's defeat on this Asymmetry. Had the President been selected by simple popular vote, Clinton II would have won.

But this also got me thinking about other places with asymmetric.

## The Sri Lankan Parliament

For example, consider the assignment of parliamentary seats to electoral districts in Sri Lanka.

If we plot the number of seats per district and voter population, we get the following graph:

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GTG6eoWIsN2upJ9SOiWCyQ.png)

(For completeness, I've assigned the 29 National List seats to electoral districts, in proportion of voter population).

The magic equation is:

```
Seats = 12.084 * Voter Population (in Millions) + 1.9854
```

Or approximately,

```
Seats = 12 * Voter Population (in Millions) + 2
```

For every million voters, each electoral district has 12 MPs, plus 2. The "2" represents the advantage small districts have. For example, if a district had zero voters, it would still have about two seats.

Hence, while the Sri Lankan parliament is uni-cameral, there is a "House" + "Senate" dynamic. Where each electoral district has 2 "senators" (irrespective of population), and some number of "representatives" proportional to population.

This is not an accident. When the constitution defined the assignment of seats, 36 were assigned, 4 each, to each of the 9 provinces. Regardless of population. 160 were allocated to electoral districts, in proportion to voter population. The remaining 29 formed the national list, assigned to parties in proportion to the national vote.

The allocation of the four seats within districts was also controversial. Most famously, the four seats of the northern province were allocated three to Vanni and one to Jaffna. Despite Jaffna having a significantly larger population.

## Concluding Reflections

Despite the many bugs and disadvantages discussed, I like the idea of a bicameral legislature. Done right, it has benefits. Particularly the "modulating" role of an upper house.

Time to give it another try?

# Seeing through Randomness

### A thought experiment

(Disclaimer: We could repeat this experiment with a statistically significant audience. Unfortunately, I don't have the resources to do that. So, dear reader, take this, not as a "scientific experiment" but as a "thought experiment").

## Setup

This animated gif (Box World 1) consists of a grid of red and white boxes. A box could be red or white with an equal (50%) random probability. So any patterns you see are entirely random.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pX6eoAxAMzNhlTCwpQgUXg.gif)

I generated a very similar grid (Box World 2). The generation method is identical to Box World 1, except for five boxes.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qx1wHBgqqEgS06pXfFnYaQ.gif)

Four boxes (in shape of a cross) were white all the time. While the box in their centre changed colours at a constant frequency.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Pys94m0gaOm94aQNs_UYAA.gif)

## Experiment 1

I asked a group of friends, "Each of the box worlds is either random or NOT random. Which of the following is true?"

* Both are random

* Only one is random

* Only two is random

* Neither is random

All claimed that both were Random.

## Experiment 2

I then revealed that Box World 2 was not random. But didn't show why. Instead, I encouraged my friends to explain why it was not Random.

Again no one was able to spot the cross. Instead, they came up with various theories. I noticed two patterns in the theories:

* The assumption that intervals of time that were different were the same. And hence, that boxes changed colour with constant frequency, when they didn't.

* Mistaking the colour of boxes.

The second pattern was a simple error. The first pattern was more interesting. It seemed that "time" was a bi-product of the pattern. Just as the pattern could be a bi-product of time.

## Conclusions

Based on my statistically insignificant thought experiment, I came to the following conclusions.

* Humans are bad at "seeing through" randomness.

* Humans see patterns where none exists.

* Humans don't have an absolute sense of time. Instead, time infers from changing patterns.

# Time and Impermanence

### On Clock Time and Psychological Time

When do we describe something as "Permanent"? Usually, it involves time. The "Permanent" thing endures unchanged across time.

For example, a "Permanent Resident" has permanent home rights to some place. A "Permanent Secretary" never gets fired from a ministry. A "Permanent Art Collection" is a museum's for eternity. At least in theory.

In practice, whenever we talk of "Permanence" of a thing, we compare it to another thing. A "Permanent Resident" is permanent relative to a resident on (say) a temporary visa. The former is more permanent relative to the latter. But not in an absolute sense. A PR might lose their PR for (say) violating regulations. A "Permanent Secretary" never serves forever. In the end, they have to retire. In practice, permanent is not relative to eternity. But relative to the people in the ministry who are not permanent. Like a minister, or secretary of state, who changes with the government in power. A "Permanent Art Collection" is relative to those works that are (say) on loan.

Hence, it seems that "Permanence" is always relative to "Impermanence". We don't have a notion of the former not relative to the latter.

But then, where does time come in?

## Clock Time

All our notions of time involve an interplay of Permanence and Impermanence.

For example, the earth revolves around the sun. This pattern is permanent. And from it, we derive our notion of a "year". And we measure many impermanent things relative to the "year". Our harvest might fail, but the earth will still circumlocute the sun.

"Day" is a similar concept. Even the Caesium Atomic Clock assumes that photons transition atoms in"permanent" patterns.

But what if these patterns are not absolute? We know they are not absolute. From Relativity Theory. But these "relative differences" are not detectable in practical life. We can't perceive that a clock travelling at speed keeps different time to one at rest.

But from experience, we know. That clock time seems to travel at different speeds at different "times". When bored, time almost stops. When entertained, time runs at light speed.

## Psychological Time

We noted that "Permanence" is always relative to "Impermanence". Hence, to see something as "Permanent", we need to be aware of those other things that are "Impermanent". The less change we observe, time slows down. More change and time speeds up.

For example, when bored, nothing seems to happen. Or when nothing seems to happen, we bore. At these times, time stops. Conversely, when we are "entertained", things are "happening". And tempus fugit. Waiting for no man.

This alternative definition of time is not relative to "objective" phenomena. Like a revolving or rotating earth, or caesium atoms. It is purely subjective. Depending on what the observer observes.

"Objective" clock time might seem "objective". But there is a problem. All these "objective" things need to be subjectively observed. There is no "objective" way of observing "objective" things.

## Concluding Fantasies

Imagine you're sitting in a silent room. Nothing moves. Nothing sounds. Except for a clock. That ticks, and its second hand jumps in small increments. Nothing changes. Except for the clock.

What if we remove the clock from the room? Does time stop?

Now, imagine the opposite. Suppose you had super-human powers? Senses with which you could sense "everything". To the movement of every subatomic particle.

That silent room would transform into a hive of activity. Between the ticks of the clock, there would be an infinity of happenings. And even that tick, that movement of the second hand, would not be a single event. But an infinity.

If such complete and perfect observation was possible, would time exist? Would permanence exist? Would ignorance exist?

# Two-Thirds

### 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election

## 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election

In A Brief History of Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections, I concluded with a hypothetical and unscientific prediction on how many seats each party would get in the 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election. Assuming that voting ran along the lines of the 2019 Presidential Election.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vaXX89MK1DIizGZrGtV_iA.png)

In this article, I attempt a more rigorous estimate. And attempt an answer to the question "Can the SLPP win a Super-Majority?"

## Methodology and Assumptions

### Assumption 1 — Base Vote Assumption

For each political party, I estimate the "base vote" of that party. A "base voter of a party" is a voter who will always vote for that party. Hence, each party is guaranteed of "base votes".

For each polling division, I assume the least proportion of votes the party got, historically, is a reasonable estimate of the base vote ("Base Vote Assumption). "Historically" means the last three elections (2004, 2010, 2015).

### Assumption 2 — Floating Vote Assumptions

The difference between the total vote and the base vote summed across all parties is the floating vote. These come from voters not "pledged" to any particular party. And hence could go to any party.

In the 2019 Presidential Election, the UNP won about 75% of the floating vote in the Northern and Eastern provinces, while SLPP won about 50% of the floating vote throughout the rest of the country.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XzOURPHGTvd53ffDznoLzQ.png)

In this analysis, I look at scenarios where the SLPP gets various proportions of the floating vote. From 0% to 100%. In each of these scenarios, I make the following assumptions ("Floating Vote Assumption"):

* In the Northern and Eastern Province, the TNA gets about 80% of the remaining floating vote, while the UNP gets 20%

* In the rest of the island, the UNP gets 60% of the remaining floating vote, and the JVP gets 40%.

For example, in the scenario where the SLPP gets 50% of the floating vote, in Colombo, the UNP will get 30% of the floating vote, and the JVP will get 20%.

### Assumption 3 — Alliance Assumption

Finally, I assume the following alliances:

* The EPDP, JHU and the CWC will ally with the SLPP

* The UPF, SLMC and Eastern Muslim parties will ally with the UNP

* The TNA and JVP will contest independently

Hence, we have four political groups: SLPP, UNP, TNA and JVP.

[Disclaimer: All three assumptions could be invalid in practice. Given the unpredictability of both politicians and voters. Hence, take these results with a pinch of NaCl.]

## Results

### The Worst-Case (for the SLPP)

If the SLPP alliance win 0% of the floating vote and only win their "base", they will still win 94 seats. Four seats ahead of the UNP alliance. Hence, it seems impossible that the UNP would win the next general election, even if the SLPP does very poorly.

### The 50% Case

Assuming the SLPP alliance won 50% of the floating vote islandwide (similar to what they gained during the 2019 Presidential Election), they would win 128 seats. A comfortable majority of +31 seats. But no ⅔ super-majority.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*b0xwbZynpu-QYiaQDZG_Uw.png)

### The Best Case

In the best case, where the SLPP wins 100% of the floating vote, they would still win 157 seats. 7+ above the ⅔ super-majority limit of 150 seats. This case does seem unlikely, given that it would mean winning all of the floating votes in the Nothern and Eastern provinces.

## Conclusions

Even in the worse case, the SLPP should end-up the party with the most seats in parliament. They are likely to win a ½ absolute-majority comfortably. And have a not-unreasonable chance of winning a ⅔ super-majority.

# Why IT isn't IT

### From Typists to Email

## Typists and "Old IT"

There was a time when nobody in the company typed.

If you were a junior employee, you would prepare your letter in writing and give it to a pool of secretaries. You would get your typed-letter a few days later. If you were lucky.

If you were a boss, you had the privilege of a personal secretary. Usually pretty. Who, among other things, took dictation. You would read-out your letter, and she would note it in short-hand. Then she'd type it out. You would read the typed-draft and suggest some corrections. After a few iterations, by the end of the day, the letter would get sent. Another boss in another department or company would go through the same process to send you a reply. A few weeks later.

"Old IT" in the old days, used to be like typing. Like the "typing pool", the "IT Department" was vertical. And as typist did all the typing, all IT had to go through the "IT guys".

Typists provided a particular service. Translate verbal or hand-written communication into printed communication, usually in a standard format. Similarly, IT Departments also provided a very standard and templated service. You had the choice of a small set of hardware and software. Which satisfied a small set of needs. Hence, IT Departments across different organisations (say Banking, Tourism, or Retail) were almost identical. Just as their typing pools were.

"IT guys" had very specific skills. Juniors were responsible for maintenance and troubleshooting. Seniors were responsible for procurement and tenders. The old IT department never developed any software. Everything outsourced to 3rd party vendors. Like the IT Department, these vendors were also generic. And knew little about the organisation.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*izf42e2dxGeQl_UJPAhtvQ.png)

## Email and "New IT"

These days (almost) all professionals can type. Due to word processing software and email. This "universal typing trend" made the traditional typist almost obsolete. And also transformed communication in the organisation.

What was a niche skill concentrated in a vertical (the typing pool), became horizontal. Everyone could type. Typed communication was no longer restricted to a small set of "important letters". But to any communication. Communication cycles that used to take several days now took seconds.

"New IT" is like email.

IT is no longer restricted to a small set of standard and templated services provided by third-party vendors. Just like you can send anything in an email, a modern IT department can satisfy (almost) any organisational need. An increasing portion of an organisation's value and competitive advantage concentrates in its digital data and IT development.

Just as anyone can write email, the modern IT department is, not a vertical, but a horizontal. Often embedded in each part of the company, satisfying specific needs. Since templated, off-the-shelf software cannot be used for solving particular problems, companies build their own software for their individual needs.

The modern IT department has very different people. While old IT seniors did procurement and tenders, new bosses architect systems and try to predict the future needs and trends of the company. IT juniors build those systems, and understand the organisation.

## Achala's Depression

When I met Achala a couple of weeks ago, he was depressed. There was so much to do, but no one was allowed to do anything. Could I advise him whether he should stay? Or leave and work on something more interesting?

Achala (not their real name) had graduated from Moratuwa two years ago. With a first-class degree in Computer Engineering, and a top-10 GPA. He then joined one of Sri Lanka's largest companies. One with tens of thousands of employees and several subsidiaries.

I asked him why no one was allowed to do anything. "It's the CTO", he said. Everything remotely IT related that the company does, had to be approved by the CTO. And the CTO blocked everything.

This seemed bizarre to me. It was like having every single email in the large company having to be typed by a single secretary. Who refused to type anything.

I did a quick LinkedIn search for the CTOs. I couldn't locate his university but seemed to be somewhere in England. The degree had the words "management", "administration" and "technology". But no "engineering" or "science" or "development".

Achala wanted to build a system that would make the organisation's logistics systems more efficient. A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation indicated a saving of millions of rupees every month. However, the Typist CTO had blocked the idea, claiming that they were just about to buy some software from the US (costing millions of dollars) that would (apperently) do the same thing.

I am somewhat familiar with this software, and I don't know how a standard "relational database" might optimise transport logistics in Sri Lanka.

## Concluding Reflections

I've spoken to several CEO of large Sri Lankan companies, and almost all understand and want to adopt "Modern IT". But paradoxically, virtually all these organisations are bogged down with "Old IT".

The top reason for this paradox is a rotten middle-management of Typist-CTO-types. Who depend on the old regime for their careers. They no nothing but Old IT. And hence, flog companies with third-rate, irrelevant systems from abroad, costing millions. Of dollars.

Instead, Sri Lankan organisations should be building their own software. If a random vendor of generic software, located thousands of miles away, knows more about your business than you, you should probably get out of that business. It's only a matter of time before someone kicks you out.

Oddly, some public organisations (e.g. government departments, state universities), seem to be well ahead of private ones, in this respect. They are quickly realising how obsolete outsourcing software is. And hence, they are building their software and development arms.

Hope the private sector follows suit.

# Why Data Scientists

### On Data Science Super-Powers

Data Scientists are some of the most misunderstood and under-appreciated people in the world. And to the world's cost.

In this article, I hope to help you understand data scientists a bit better.

Disclaimer: While I have some grounding in statistics and statistical machine learning, I'm not a data scientist myself. However, I have been fortunate to have worked with some genuinely world-class data scientists. And this article is based more on my experience of their skills. And less on my own.

## What is Data Science?

Data Science is the science of making sense of data. "Making sense" usually means "Making useful sense". The "Making sense" has to be practical and productive.

"Practical and Productive" usually involve explaining the past, or predicting the future. The problem with data is that all data is "in the present". Even if it might be "about the past" or future. For example, the artefacts in an archaeological site are "in the present" they are not pieces of bone "in 30,000 BCE". They are pieces of bone in 2019, which might be from "30,000 BCE".

Hence, an essential part of Data Science is about making "significant" conclusions about the past or future. Using data, which is always from the present.

## Three Super-Powers

The best data scientists have three super-powers.

### The Past

Data Scientists can use data from the present to make accurate conclusions about the past. Or "significant" conclusions about the past. "Significant" conclusions have a high probability of being correct.

"Insignificant' conclusions, on the other hand, have a high chance of being false. Usually, because there is a better, often more straightforward explanation of the data.

The best data scientists also have an uncanny ability to make counter-intuitive "I never thought of that" type conclusions about the past. These often force us to revise our view of the past.

### The Future

The future is exactly like the past. "Conclusions" about the past are replaced with "Predictions" about the future. These are precisely the same because all the data is about the present. And hence, we might as well "predict" the past, or "conclude" about the future, using this data.

As with the past, the best data scientists find counter-intuitive predictions about the future. They might be able to predict a new trend that no one has thought of. Hence, Data scientists play an essential role in planning roadmaps and the "strategic visions" of organizations.

### Present

Most people are too preoccupied with the future and past to worry about the present. But the present is the most important "time" for an organization. "How is the organization doing now?" "What do people think about our app now?" "Is our party popular now?"

Data Science techniques play a vital role in explaining "the now". And the best data scientists are excellent at this.

## Concluding thoughts

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RrnWOuRe1802jVMZrwPSFA.png)

Sadly, very few organizations make the best use of this triad of super-powers: Past, Future and Present. Most organizations are happy to use data scientists as a "press office". To postrationalize their (often foolish) actions.

It's time to change.

[Comment]

The main problem I address is one of Sri Lankan National Identity (or the lack of one). It is a problem faced by all Sri Lankans, including the Sinhala and Buddhist majorities.

I don't explicitly address any other problems faced by minorities, or majorities. Social, political or economic.

I haven't suggested a solution to the Identity Problem. Though I do suggest that Sri Lankan identity is being superseded by a Sinhala Buddhist Identity. This is not because I want it to, but because it is what is happening. There is a void, and it is being filled.

If you believe that I agree and support with what is happening, then you would be correct. I would be supporting racism.

But then, I neither agree, nor support.

# National Anthems

### And other "National" things

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PPt0JyuT2PJsu2Pm1SH-ug.png)

There is quite a "conversation" about the Sri Lankan National Anthem. And what languages to sing it in. When I say "conversation", I'm being kind and inaccurate. One side angrily shouts "Both languages". The other side, "One Language".

There is no "conversation" as such. Only angry tantrums in disconnected echo-chambers.

## Imaginary Things

"National Anthems" are a subset of a broader set of "National Things". Like "National Flags", "National Cuisine", "National Flowers" and "National Cricket Teams". These are collective identities that unite all the members of the "National Club".

There is a problem, though.

The members of the club are real people. Real humans. Homo sapiens with bodies and lives. Things like "Nations" (as our Ethnicities, Religions, and Brands) are all imaginary. They are merely cognitive inventions or myths. They don't exist. In Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Yuval Noah Harari talks about a "pain test". If something is real, it feels pain. If something is imaginary, it doesn't feel pain. A soldier fighting for Sri Lanka feels pain. Sri Lanka doesn't.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*M6_LSidv66tFsi2Xaqk2zQ.jpeg)

Hence, imaginary things have to rely on real things for their survival. The former pass on part of their "personality" to the latter. This "personality" is known as "identity". The real humans adopt the "identities" of imaginary things.

Different imaginary things have all manner of identities. When a human says they're Sri Lankan, they adopt the "Sri Lankan Identity". When they are "Buddhist", they assume the "Buddhist identity. When they are "Socialist", the "Socialist Identity". And so on.

The moment these identities fall apart, the imaginary entities follow suit.

## Sri Lankan Identity

"Imaginary" Sri Lanka depends on "real" Sri Lankans adopting a "Sri Lankan Identity". Without a Sri Lankan identity, there is no Sri Lanka.

And I'd argue that Sri Lanka has no identity. Or at best a very fragile identity. We have various racial, religious, caste, class, and school identities, but these always trump the national identity. Hence, everyone is more Sinhala, Hindu, Govigama, "English-Speaking" or "Royalist", than they are Sri Lankan.

No nation can survive for long without a national identity. Without one, one of two things happen: A) the nation dies, or B) another identity becomes the "National Identity".

Sri Lanka has always had "another identity". And that is the "Sinhala Identity" or in many cases a "Sinhala-Buddhist Identity". At times competing with the Sri Lankan Identity, and at other times superseding it. If this identity becomes our national identity, it's not because of racist politicians or monks, or a stupid electorate. It's because it filled a void. There was nothing else to fill that void.

## Concluding Problem

Can Sri Lankans Identify with our national anthem? I admire both the lyrics and music. But then, I can understand it. What about Sri Lankan's who can't?

It's easy to say that we should sing an Anthem in one language or two languages. Or ask questions on which language it should be sung in. But this is not the real question. The real question is: How do we build national identity?

While singing in Sinhala only might sound racist and exclusive to some, the reality is that it fills a void. The solution to that "problem" is not singing in many languages. The solution is to find something to fill that void.

# Aphorisms on the State

### And Democracy, Education, Development, Equity and Identity

## The State

* A state is a collection of individuals known as citizens.

* Every individual has needs

* Some individuals have the ability to satisfy needs. We call this ability power.

* Citizens act to satisfy some subset of their needs. Which subset varies from situations to situation. And might be unpredictable and irrational.

* Control is the ability of one individual to influence the actions of another individual. Citizens with needs are controlled by the citizens who have power to satisfy those needs.

* The law is a collection of conditions. That specify if something happens, then something else must happen. Whether it will happen depends how the citizens decide to act.

* Different states differ in how laws are defined, executed and judged. This system of defining, executing and judging laws is known as a "system of government".

* A Democracy is a system of government where all citizens have an equal opportunity to act in defining, executing and judging laws.

* Since citizens act to satisfy their needs, these actions in defining, executing and judging laws are controlled by citizens with power. Hence, in a democracy defining, executing and judging are influenced by citizens with power.

## Education

* A Perfect Democracy is a system of government where all citizens have an equal influence to act in defining, executing and judging laws.

* An educated citizen is one with the ability to influence productive outcomes.

* Hence, a perfect democracy with educated citizens achieves productive outcomes. One without educated citizens does not achieve productive results.

## Equity

* Equity is the equalise of a state's citizens' power.

* In an equal state, equal opportunity to act in defining, executing and judging laws converges with equal influence in defining, executing and judging laws. Democracy and Perfect Democracy converge.

* In an unequal state, influence concentrates in the hands of a few. Such a state is known as an oligarchy.

* Hence, Democracy can coexist with both Oligarchy and Perfect Democracy. Depending on the nature of equity.

## Development

* Development is a measure of the sophistication of a state's citizens' needs. A more developed state has citizens with more sophisticated needs.

* Sophistication is a measure of the intrinsic nature of needs. Needs that must be satisfied externally (extrinsically, hence less intrinsically) are less sophisticated. Needs that must be satisfied intrinsically, are more sophisticated.

* Hence, citizens whose needs are more sophisticated are less vulnerable to control from other citizens.

* Hence, a developed state is more likely to tend towards a perfect democracy, as opposed to an oligarchy.

## Identity

* State Identity is a citizen's need to align their needs with the needs of other citizens. A state with strong state identity has citizens with shared needs.

* State Identity tends to have "medium" sophistication. It relies on some extrinsic "feedback signals", but also intrinsic beliefs.

* The need to act in defining, executing and judging laws of the state (i.e. "participate"), is an example of state identity.

* Hence, states with strong state identities are more likely to tend towards a perfect democracy, as opposed to an oligarchy.

# The Price of Cars

### How do cars retain value over time?

Since moving to Sri Lanka, I have not owned a car. Mostly due to my work circumstances. Parking in Fort is difficult and expensive. And it has always been easier to hail a taxi.

But is it cheaper?

A friend and I were debating this. If you own a personal car, there is the initial price, fuel, insurance and maintenance. The actual value of the vehicle offsets these costs. Which you would sell later. If you ride taxis, there is a taxi fare. For fairness, we should also consider other factors. For example, if you ride taxis, there is the "comfort benefit" of not having to drive. Conversely, if you own a car, there are conveniences like storage and consistency.

My friend and I agreed on most of the costs and benefits. But one factor we could not agree on was the "value" of the car.

My friend claimed that "in Sri Lanka" cars were investments "like land". And usually the value of a car went up or at least stayed fixed. You could buy a car, and then hope to sell it in a few years, "for the same price".

This seemed a bit sanguine to me. But rather than dismissing the claim, I thought of pulling some data to answer the question: How do cars retain value over time?

## Methodology and Results

I scraped newspapers and magazines online for buy and sell advertisements for used cars. I tracked the averages of buy and sell prices for various makes and models of vehicles over time. For simplicity, I ignored millage and accessories. I assumed with a large enough sample, these factors would cancel out.

I computed value on January 1, 2017, and then three years later, or today. January 1, 2020.

### Toyota Prius

Here's how the price of Toyota Prii changed during the last three years. I had statistically significant data for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 models.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8yuJR-jZ5QQGbpNsXLfTIQ.png)

For example, the 2012 model was about Rs. 5.3M beginning of 2017, and now sells for about Rs. 4.2M.

### Honda Vezel

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qDSKQVU1u2FaPsVDSh5KRA.png)

### Suzuki Swift

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*txohh9SLn5cFMEZ4bFLxhw.png)

### Annual Depreciation

For each of the cars, I computed annual depreciation. To factor in LKR devaluation and inflation, I also calculated the equivalent dollar prices and depreciation.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uAQy1XYQVn1SnGBOqYfffg.png)

### SUVs Only

Some of the results are not statistically significant, but I included them for comparison. They didn't seem substantially different from Non-SUV vehicles.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yXcUvCxmkEza5eTu_8Pjxw.png)

## Conclusion

This is a very rough analysis. But it seems that my friend was a bit too optimistic about our car market. On average, it appears that a car loses about 7% of its LKR value annually or about 13% of its USD value.

Now, does that make my Uber rider cheaper? Or should I buy a car? Let me ponder that question for a few days.

# At some future date...

### Ode to a City

At some future date,

when I'm older, wiser, and content,

I will, by chance, visit a city.

A city I once lived in long ago.

A city I once loved.

I will expect nothing.

I will be infinitely happy.

Afterall, it is when one expects nothing that one has infinite happiness.

I will sit on a bench in a park, or by a lake, or a canal.

Watching the water sparkle.

Feeling the wind in my eyes.

Breathing in the grass and the mist.

I will think: Peace.

Nothing can be more perfect.

But I will have spoken too soon.

For you will have sat next to me.

And as I watch the water, and breath the mist.

With the same breath, you would be watching the water, and breathing the mist.

And at that moment,

I will turn my head, as you turn yours.

I will look into your eyes.

And you gaze into mine.

At some future date...

# Hills of San Francisco

### From first principles

[Originally published on Facebook in 2018]

I'm a big fan of "hiking" cities. A couple of years ago, guided by Adah Bakalinsky's excellent book "The Stairways of San Francisco", I completed 29 walks (the book has 30*), which took me to over 400 of San Francisco's stairways. Some of the stairways were hidden in innocuous neighborhoods, while others climbed-up San Francisco's many hills. The summits of these hills afford some of the most beautiful views of the city, and the Bay.

[* I left one out, so that I'd always have a reason to return to SF]

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9-aUlwCALB_3RJInnhwsSQ.jpeg)

Like many cities, San Francisco was once claimed to be built on seven hills (Telegraph Hill, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Rincon Hill, Twin Peaks, Mount Davidson and Mount Sutro). The other cities include Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca. However, from my stairways walks, I was sure that there were many more. Gladys Hansen's San Francisco Almanac claimed that there were 42. Other lists on Wikipedia and various travel blogs had slightly varying lists each with around 50 hills.

Following-up from my stairways project, I wanted to climb every hill in San Francisco — which I ended up doing in October and November 2016. This note is a belated attempt to document some of my findings and reflections.

## What is a Hill?

Before climbing a hill, you need to find it. But before you can find it, you need to define it. There was no "definitive list" of San Francisco's hills. Like I mentioned, the number varied from seven to 50. Hence, I needed to "define" a hill — from first principles

### Question 1: What is a Hill?

According to wikipedia, "A hill is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain." Or to put it more simply, a hill is a piece of land, that is at a higher elevation than the land around it. Simple enough so far.

### Question 2: How high must a hill be to be called a hill?

While a Mountain is often defined as a hill that is more than 300m (~1000ft), I couldn't find a "minimum height limit" for a hill. I thought of using 50m as a rough starting point. In retrospect, this proved a serendipitous choice.

### Question 3: How exactly does one measure the height of a hill?

Geographers use the concept of "topographic prominence"; the "prominence" of a hill being the height of the hill from the lowest contour line surrounding it, which contains no higher peak.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-3dveh0uzI9gTAID)

## My Data

I started with some geographic information system (GIS) data for San Francisco, which tabulated altitude by longitude and latitude. The altitudes looked something like this. Dark Green marks sea level (0m); Yellow marks 50m; Dark Red 250m. For reference, I've also marked some "official" San Francisco hills.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MYtDGZoO7yM-RufL)

Note: My definition of "San Francisco" is somewhat arbitrary. The San Bruno mountains just south of the area on my map, are actually much taller than the tallest hills of San Francisco. But for simplicity, I excluded these mountains and looked at a rough square north of these. Interestingly, this my chosen area also captures part of Yerba Buena island.

Next, I wrote some code to find the topographic prominence of each location. The colour denotes the prominence of the highest hill within the contour line containing a point. As before Dark Green marks sea level (0m); Yellow marks 50m; Dark Red 250m. The labels including the rank, prominence and height of the hills.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*drUXZANKl1O67Jx1)

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*c8wxb_wDsnpH_uAe)

## A Short Analysis

Conveniently, picking the minimum prominence for a hill as 50m, resulted in exactly 50 hills for San Francisco. That is, there were 50 hills in San Francisco with a prominence of at least 50m. As I mentioned, serendipitous.

My new list of hills differed from most official lists in several interesting ways. For example,

* Mount Davidson (271ft) is considered the tallest hill in San Francisco. Mount Sutro (250ft) is usually listed as the second tallest, as it has the second tallest altitude from sea level. However, situated on a plateau, it's prominence was only 115m. According to my data, the second tallest hill was the North Peak of Twin Peaks, with a prominence of 258ft. This difference between prominence and altitude was significant for many other hills.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ua0LgquR8ygoEo19)

2. Several "official" hills (including Rincon Hill) didn't appear on my list, because their prominence was below my 50m limit.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XOW6QUc2u85c0Ys_)

3. Many well known hills (including Telegraph Hill and Nob Hill) were not single hills but clusters of hills.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CIXo8DL2l6xRhPmS)

4. There were parts of the City (e.g. the Presidio) which had many hills (accordingly to my definition) which didn't have official names.

![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2Zjs8ys6is53VOOG)

## My top 10 hills

Most hills are special for some reason, and it's difficult to rank them. But for the sake of coming of with a "Top 10", I attempted to do so. My criteria are roughly: 1) views from the top; 2) surrounding neighbourhood (after all, these are urban hills); and 3) the climb up.

* (My Favourite) Telegraph Hill (74m Prominence — or 29th most prominent). Amazing views of Bay, both bridges and City. Interesting garden and houses on the way up. Right in the middle of the city.

* Bernal Heights (126m, 6th). Probably my favourite views of the city, from all directions.

* Pacific Heights (92m, 16th). Beautiful views of the Bay, especially down the Lyon Stairs.

* Mount Davidson (270m, 1st). Views. Interesting climb through wooded forest.

* Twin Peaks — North (258m, 2nd). Views of the city. Though a bit too touristy.

* McLaren Hill (151m, 4th). Several peaks. Lots of hiking trails. Quiet. Views of the city.

* Russian Hill (52m, 48th). The hill itself is not particularly interesting, but there are many picturesque ways down the hill, including the famous Lombard Street, Green street, and Vallejo Street.

* Strawberry Hill (53m, 45th). Right in the middle of Golden Gate Park. Beautiful views of the park.

* Mount Sutro (115m, 9th). Views. Interesting Climb-up.

* Edge Hill (81m, 24th). Views of the City.

## Next Project

Views from the tops of hills can be nice, but the climb up can be strenuous. My next project is to climb all these hills of San Francisco in the most optimal order — where "most optimal order" means climbing the hills such that "distance climbing uphill" is minimized. That should be an interesting problem to solve.
