### A Philosophical Algorithm

## Inspiration

Many philosophies (including Buddhism) have the "Middle Path" or the "Middle Way" as a core idea. However, I was inspired to write this article by the following series of news stories that I happened to read or watch in the last couple of weeks:

* Why did 52% of Brits vote for Brexit? The Indian yogi and author Jaggi Vasudev described Brexit as a backlash against "a pendulum" which was pushed too hard in the direction of "right".[1]

* The two sides of the Abortion debate (Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice) are increasingly becoming more and more extreme. And like many Left vs. Right debates, there is increasingly less opportunity for a mutually acceptable compromise. [2]

* One party in a coalition government is severely criticized for negotiating and compromising on policy with their coalition partner [3]

All these scenarios have a common theme: A complex issue, which has been over-simplified by accepting one narrow view to be completely right, and the other (or all others) to be completely wrong.

## The Middle Path Algorithm

While the above scenarios might sound annoying or even stupid, they are common, and like most cognitive biases, have a common cause. Simple ideas are always more popular than complex ones, because they require less brain power to process. This might have been an advantageous evolutionary strategy when we were living simples lives on the African Savana, but it doesn't work in today's complex world.

To prevent myself from falling into similar traps, I thought of the following "Middle Path Algorithm":

>>> For any idea, concept, opinion, or fact (let's call it X) that one is thinking about, and might be inclined to accept, consider the following:

>>> Is X right? Why? What are the consequences of X being right?

>>> Is X wrong? Why? What are the consequences of X being wrong?

>>> Can X be both right and wrong? Or neither right nor wrong? Or some state of rightness or wrongness in between? Why? What are the consequences of X being in such a state of rightness or wrongness in between?

>>> Recursively apply this algorithm to any other ideas emerging from this process.

The goal is simple: To look at an idea from all angles and points of view; not just one.

## Pros of the Middle Path

The Middle Path provides immunization against the following diseases, by driving a contemplation of what lies between extremes.

* Premature Thought: Thought is a knife [4]. The moment we "lock in" to a view, we split the world into two universes, one where the view is right, and another where it is wrong, and accept the former as "truth", and the latter as "false". Very often this choice is simplistic, and the "cut" premature. We narrow our minds, without sufficient investigation

* Nit-Picking: Once we lock into a view, we have to support it and "back it up". Often the facts we have at hand are insufficient, or are not convincing. So we nit-pick ones which support our view.

* Ego: And as this insufficiency and unconvincingness exacerbates, we need to reinforce whatever facts with our egos. Suddenly, an attack on our view is a personal attack on ourselves. And before we know it, we are down the slippery slope of identity groups, "being offended", political correctness and worse.

* Lack of Compromise: It is natural for ideas to compete and contradict. Often two good ideas might be mutually contradictory or even exclusive. Compromise or choice is inevitable, and possibly optimal. Often such compromise is shunned because we live in a "one or the other" world.

## Cons of the Middle Path

Applying "Is X wrong? Why? What are the consequences of X being wrong?" to the Middle Path, the following objections come to mind:

* Sound-Bites: The middle path is poor at generating simple ideas, sound-bites or click-bait. This might sound a good thing, but it makes for poor social media memes, and political speeches. Don't expect a student of the Middle Path to be the next hot new politician, or social media influencer.

* Strong Ideas: It leads to weakly held views. In today's world of strength and strong opinions, many (including many of my friends) found this a "con".

* Evil: It condones "evil" and other bad things. "Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin....etc were definitely evil weren't they?" you ask. How can anyone argue against that? Well they could. But it would be complicated. To start with, such an argument would begin with "Evil is ABC", and that itself would lead to too many contradictions.

## Concluding Exercise

If you're not convinced about the Middle Path, try considering the following:

>>> Is the Middle Path right? Why? What are the consequences of the Middle Path being right?

>>> Is the Middle Path wrong? Why? What are the consequences of the Middle Path being wrong?

>>> Can the Middle Path be both right and wrong? Or neither right nor wrong? Or some state of rightness or wrongness in between? Why? What are the consequences of the Middle Path being in such a state of rightness or wrongness in between?
