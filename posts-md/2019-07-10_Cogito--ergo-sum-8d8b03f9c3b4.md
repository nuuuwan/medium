### A Tale of Me, Myself and Mosquito

## From Concrete to Abstract

I smell. Blood. Then a high-frequency, buzzing sound. Like a saw. Then a light rustling feeling on the hairs on my arm. Then I see. At close range, I see her proboscis is erect like a spear, about to bore into my naked skin.

So far, the mosquito has meant many things to me. The complex, sickly metallic smell of blood. The complex nuances and harmonics of the buzzing sound of an insect. The complex and almost imperceptible perception of a small creature landing on ones skin. The complex sight of an organism that has evolved and dominated the earth for millions of years. Complex things. Concrete things.

But, suddenly, I think. Something completely different.

All concrete complexities are replaced by something abstract and simple: She is the enemy. I must kill her.

## From Cogito to Ergo

The smells, sounds, touches and sights are concrete things in the physical world. But the "enemy" is an abstraction of my mind.

She is the enemy because her like carry all manner of horrible diseases (Dengue comes to mind). And that sting. Few things are as painful (or so I think, in that split second). Justifying the label: Enemy.

Immediately, I begin to make plans. Plans for the future. I dream for a time when I will be just as I am, but this mosquito will be squashed dead by a sharp blow by the palm of my hand. I crave a future where I exist, and the mosquito does not.

The moment I make these plans, the future is born. And I will persist into this future. I have become a permanent being. Something real. I, now, am (ergo)!

## From Permanent to Impermenent

And then I realise the time.

Nearly 8pm. Dengue mosquitos don't bite humans at this time of night. The odds are that the mosquito, beyond the pain of her bite, is completely harmless.

As it happens, the said mosquito has been very greedy. She is completely engorged with blood (some other souls' — not mine). She gently topples on her own weight, and falls to the ground.

That future, where I exist and the mosquito does not, has not come to pass. Is this, then, a different future? One where I exist, but so does the mosquito?

It feels like that.

But them, now is not the future, is it? Now is the present. Where did the future go? Was it even real?

And if not, am I a permanent being? Or Am I?
