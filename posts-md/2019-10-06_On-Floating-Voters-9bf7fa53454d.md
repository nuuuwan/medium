# On Floating Voters

### And Predicting the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election

Like many countries, two parties dominate Sri Lankan politics: The UNP (the Greens) and the SLFP (the Blues), or one of their modern incarnations.

And like in many countries, many people always vote for one party, and never for the other. These base voters form each party's "voter base". A chunk of votes that are virtually guaranteed.

The remaining "floating voters" could vote for either party. This latter block usually ends-up deciding the outcome of the election.

In this article, I do an approximate estimation of the base votes for the Blue and Green parties, and the floating vote, and analyse some implications.

## Parenthesis: Some methodological details

An exact measure of the "base vote" would require per-voter data; each ballot would have to be tagged with the voter's ID. Since presidential elections are by secret ballot, we don't have this data. Thus, we have to resort to an approximation (see below for details). This approximation could be an over-estimate (because our estimate might include non-base-voters) or an under-estimate (because some base voters would not have voted in our sample elections).

We've restricted our analysis to the last four elections (1999, 2005, 2010 and 2015). The electorate and political views change over time, and 20 years seemed an arbitrary, but reasonable window.

We classify UNP and NDF candidates as "Green", and PA and UPFA candidates as "Blue".

Collisions and aggrements between the Greens, and Blues, and smaller parties (e.g. TNA, JVP, SLMP) complicate the "base voter" metric. In some cases, the metric might involve some voters from the "base" of these other parties. In these cases, the "base voter" estimate is inflated. The rest of the smaller party voter base is subsumed in the floating vote. [Update addressing concern from Bimal Rathnayake]

For this analysis, we use a Dorling Cartogram. To generate the cartogram, we start with a map of Sri Lanka, we circles for each polling divisions, proportional to the voter population.

Then, we compress the diagram so that the circles are next to each other.

## Green Voter Base

For each of Sri Lanka's 160 polling divisions, we estimate a party's "base vote" in that polling division as the lowest proportion of votes they received in the last four elections.

>>> For example, for the Borella polling division, the Greens received 50.1%, 61.8%, 57.5% and 67.0% in the last four elections. Hence, we use 50.1% as an estimate of the voter base for the Greens in Borella.

The five polling divisions with the highest % voter base for the Greens are Paddiruppu (79%), Vavuniya (66%), Colombo West (65%), Trincomalee (64%), and Kilinochchi (63%).

The five polling divisions with the highest Green voter base (in absolute numbers) are Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya (121,737), Batticaloa (71,611), Colombo Central (60,279), Harispattuwa (57,763), and Kaduwela (50,370), extrapolating to the 2015 voter population.

In total, the Greens voter base is about 39% country-wide.

## Blue Voter Base

Similarly, the five polling divisions with the highest % voter base for the Blues are Dompe (58%), Kamburupitiya (57%), Habaraduwa (57%), Baddegama (56%), and Medawachchiya (56%).

The five polling divisions with the highest Blue voter base (in absolute numbers) are Homagama (76,986), Kesbewa (73,819), Kaduwela (70,573), Ampara (64,240) and Mahara (63,922).

In total, the Blues voter base is about 44% country-wide.

## Blue vs Green

## The Floating Vote

With the Blue and Green voter bases at 44% and 39%, the remaining 17% is the floating vote.

The five polling divisions with the highest % floating vote are Sammanthurai (52.2%), Kankesanthurai (51.3%), Mullaitivu (49.4%), Manipay (49.3%), and Kalmunai (47.9%).

The five polling divisions with the highest floating vote (in absolute numbers) are Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya (67,806), Pottuvil (38,653), Polonnaruwa (31,349), Sammanthurai (28,508), and Mutur (27,935).

[Polonnaruwa might be an anomaly, with many Blue voters defecting to Green, in the 2015 election]

While the largest densities of floating voters are in the Northern and Eastern provinces, they are spread across the whole country. In aggregate, about 3% of the 17% floating vote is in the Northern and Eastern provinces, 3% in the Central and Uva province, 4% in the Western province, and 7% across the rest of the country.

## Winning Elections

Any Blue candidate wishing to win a Presidential Election will need at least 6% of the floating vote, while a Green candidate would need at least 11%.

In the past four Presidential Elections, this is how the Blue and Green parties performed among floating voters.

### 2015

In 2015, the Greens won 51.28% of the vote, to the Blues' 47.58%. More importantly, they also won 13% of the 17% floating vote, to the Blues 3%, dominating the floating vote across the country.

### 2005

Given their relatively smaller voter base, winning the floating vote is not sufficient for the greens to win the election.

For example, the 2005 presidential election was the closest in Sri Lankan history. The Blues won 50.29% of the vote, just 180,786 votes more than the Greens' 48.43%.

While the Greens dominated the floating vote (10% to the Blues' 6%), it wasn't enough to win the election.

### 2019 Predictions

This data provides no strong prediction on who is going to win in 2019. All we can say is that the blues will (probably) win at least 44% of the vote, while the Greens will win at least 39% of the vote.

Either side has some chance of winning.
