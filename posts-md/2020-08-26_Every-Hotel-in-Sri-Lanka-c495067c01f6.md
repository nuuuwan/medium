### Tourism in Sri Lanka

# Every Hotel in Sri Lanka

### Visualising Tourism

Data is a strange beast. How it looks depends on how you look at it. If you look at it from a different angle, or even in a different color, it might look completely different.

For example, I thought I knew something about hotels in Sri Lanka. But when I took some data and plotted it, I came to some new conclusions.

...

Here is a map of every hotel in Sri Lanka. Each circle represents a hotel, rest-house or tourist accomodation. The area of the circle is proportional to the number of rooms. The color of the circle represents the type of hotel.

Here's a list of "insights" that occureed to me. They are not particularly novel. But I thought them "interesting".

### 1. Most hotels are on the South-West Coast

To be honest, I already knew this fact. Qualitatively, that is. But quantitative, I didn't expect the fact to be as skewed as it is.

Also, many would argue that Sri Lanka's best beaches are on the East coast. Sadly, tourist infrastructure in this part of the country is dwarfed by the other coast. Excluding Kandy, ancient capitals like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa also seem to have less infrastructure than expected.

### 2. Most hotels are in clusters

* The South-West can be clustered around towns like Kalpitiya, Negombo, Colombo, Panadura, Bentota, Hikkaduwa, Galle, Tangalle etc.

* Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya and Ella in the central hill

* Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Potuvil (including Arugam Bay) on the East Coast

* Matale/Dambulla, Anuradhapura, Thamankaduwa (Polonnaruwa)

* Jaffna

* Various other small clusters

Many of the smaller clusters have few "Classified Hotels", and those that have them have a relatively smaller number of rooms.

### 3. Hotels Accommodation is proportional to population and wealth

Unsurprisingly, most hotels are in relatively populous and affluent areas. Compare the above maps to this map of poverty in Sri Lanka:

The "causality" might run both ways: Hotels might make the local population wealthier. A wealthier local population might go on to build more hotel rooms.

Either way, mightn't more tourism lift up the economic lot of (say) the Eastern Province?

...

Caveat: The underlying data might need some updating. Take the suggestions below as "suggestions" and not "concrete proposals".
