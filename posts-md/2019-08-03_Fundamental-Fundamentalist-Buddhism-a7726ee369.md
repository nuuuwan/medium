### The Fundamental Fundamentals

## Fundamentalists and Fundamentalism

The rise of agitating monks (like the BBS in Sri Lanka) and attacks against other religious communities (like the Rohingya in Myanmar), has tarnished the peaceful image of Buddhism. When I talk about Fundamentalist you might think that I'm referring to these agitating factions that get up to all manner of naughtiness in the name of Buddhism.

Actually, I wanted to write about something else: A very different intepretation of Fundamentalist and Fundamentalism. I wanted to identify the most fundamental fundamental teachings of Buddhism; which themselves would imply what a fundamental adherent of those teachings would look like — or what, a fundamental fundamentalist Buddhist would look like.

## Standing on one foot

Hillel HaGadol, a Jewish religious leader and Rabbi of the 1st century BCE, was once asked to explain the whole Torah while standing on one foot. To this he replied:

>>> "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn" [Wikipedia]

Hence, Hillel described the core of the Torah as "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow" (also known as the Golden Rule).

What would a standing on one foot core explanation of Buddhism sound like?

## The Essense of Buddhism

To me the essence of Buddhism would be, Anicca, or that everything is impermanent. It is the essence because everything else of importance derives from this essential concept.

The word anicca is often heard with two others: dukkha and anatta.

Dukkha is the unsatisfactoriness felt at the impermanence of things. Sometimes we want things to persist (e.g. a healthy life), but they don't (e.g. we fall ill). At other times we want things not to persist (e.g. a painful illness), but they do (e.g. we continue to suffer from the painful illness). Both are unsatisfactory.

As we want the good times to last for ever, and the bad times to never happen, we also believe in a permanent self (or me). This is not a mere intelectual belief, proved or disproved by reasoning, but a very deep misconception that influences everything we see, feel, and think, and reason itself. Anatta means non-self, or that that there is no permanent self.

Many books explain Anicca, Dukkha, and Anatta in far greater detail and precision. In this article, I only wanted to make one point: That Dukkha, and Anatta are derived from Anicca. The same can be said for everything else of importance.

Hence, a Buddhist Rabbi Hillel could have stood, not on one foot, but on one toe, and said,

>>> "Anicca".

## Pretend Fundamentalists

Much doings in the name of Buddhism (and throughout history), contradict annica. For example,

* Buddhism couples with worldly ideologies. For example, the likes of the BBS and other nationalist groups, couple worldly Sinhala Nationalism with un-wordly Buddhism. They (not inaccurately) tie the survival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka with Sinhala rule and civilization. While it is true that without this rule and civilization (which was at times violent and militaristic) Buddhism might not have survived in Sri Lanka, it is also true that the ideas of violence and militarism contradict fundamental Buddhist tenants. For example, it is impossible to go to war (where you will need to kill the enemy) without breaking the first precept. More fundamentally, the belief in, or the need for, an eternal Sinhala race, contradicts the core of Buddhism: namely anicca.

* Buddhism has also become a huge personality cult. People who know nothing about the core of Buddhism often pray to the Buddha, asking for material gifts, and prosperity. This contradicts anatta (which is derived from anicca). Just as there is no me, there is no Buddha ("The Buddha exists for those who don't know Buddhism; and does not exists for those who do", a famous Zen saying goes). Around the primary personality of the Buddha, there are secondary satellites (usually, Buddhist monks). While monks in rural Sri Lanka often suffer great poverty, it is common for monks in the wealthy parts of Colombo to surround themselves with worshipers who shower them with expensive gifts like cars, land, and grand celebrations, wallowing in their overblown personalities.

* Buddhism has become a religion. By religion I mean "a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual elements" [Wikipedia]. Like all religions, the members of that religion act in such a way to ensure the persistence of these aspects: from practices, to texts, to organizations. This contradicts anicca, which implies that all there ideas are impermenent, and that willing them to be permanent will lead to unsatisfactoriness (dukkha). More to the point, the fundamental nature of Buddhism makes it not a religion, and more a set of philosophical statements about the cosmos (like anicca, and its derivations). Hence, the more Buddhism becomes a religion, the less it becomes Buddhism.

Such is the state of Buddhism today: a religion dominated by pretend fundamentalists.

## What next

If you consider yourself a Buddhist, are you a pretend-fundamentalist, a fundamental fundamentalist, or neither, or none of the above?

Either way, I'm not asking you to accept anything I say as gospel. That would itself be a violation of anicca (Note, this is true, even if what I say is true. Why? That's a whole new article — perhaps several).

Instead, perhaps, you could also think about fundamental fundamentals. What might they be? Would they be of any use to you? What is it that really matters? What is it that is really true?
