Open Plan Offices (OPOs), particularly at tech companies, are controversial.

Foes claim that they are a cheap ploy by profit-hungry companies to cut costs, they are noisy, and they result in less productive employees. Fans claim that they foster creativity, and community, and, ultimately, result in more productivity.

I'm not going to argue for one side or the other.

Instead, let's assume that you already work in an OPO (like I do), and don't see this changing for some time. How can you make the best of it?

## 1. "Do not disturb"

One of the most common complaints with OPOs: "Co-workers are disturbing me".

In most of these cases, the disturber does not realise that you're concentrating hard on something. A simple fix for this problem is to have a "Do not disturb" sign or convention. For example, having your headphones on, or placing an object on your monitor.

## 2. Noise-cancelling headphones

There are some excellent products around, and they are continually getting cheaper.

An alternative to the sometimes cumbersome headphones is in-ear earphones. I like the blue-tooth version, which also increases your freedom of movement.

## 3. Silent work areas

Sometimes, your noise-cancelling headphones or do-not-disturb signs are not enough. Some work needs focussed concentration and absolute silence.

Companies should have a few silent cubicles, or pods, or altogether "silent" zones for this purpose.

## 4. Partial OPOs

Sometimes, you want to restrict the openness of the OPO, partially, but not completely.

Placing Japanese panels or plants in various parts of the office restricts the "traffic" around the office, and creates the illusion of partial cubicles.

## 5. Silent time

I like to keep the times of the day when I'm most productive (usually the morning) to my self when I can do deep work. Conversely, I schedule meetings and less productive work for times of the day when I'm less productive.

The company can designate various times of the day (e.g. 8 am to 11 am), as "silent" periods. Talk and disruption can be minimised.

## 6. Noise zones

Often people are disturbed by co-workers talking between themselves or on the phone.

If there is a designated "noise zone", away from the desks and in some public area (like a micro-kitchen), talkers and phone-callers can conduct their business, without disturbing anyone.

## 7. Meta: Rules

Most companies don't have an OPO policy — a basic set of rules that all employees should follow. Many OPO problems stem from this deficiency.

Conversely, if all employees are aware of the OPO rules, if new employees are educated, and if employees are reminded of these rules (a list stuck on a wall), many of these problems can be avoided.
