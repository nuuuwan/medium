# Knowing, Not Knowing, and Learning

### On Tagines, Liszt, and Programming

Suppose you want to do something. Cook a Moroccan Tagine, master Un Sospiro, or code in a new programming language.

Two fetters get in the way of your doing: Knowing and Not Knowing.

If you think you already know how to cook a Tagine, you'll burn the meat. If you think you don't know, you'll never get as far as the kitchen.

"But wait", I hear you say. "If I already know, why would I burn the meat?"

There is a stark difference between knowing to do something and doing something. When we say we know how to do something, we've abstracted the task into a set of steps, which we know. Knowing consists of a finite number of abstract steps. Doing something consists of an infinite number of concrete moments.

Not knowing is precisely the same as knowing. We abstract the problem into a finite set of steps, which we claim not to know, or unable to do. The knowledge of the lack of knowledge is still knowledge.

The only way to do something is to stop thinking about knowing or not knowing and to do it. When one does without thinking, one is not shackled by knowledge or the lack of it. One ends up, not only doing, but also free to absorb and internalize all the infinite concrete moments of the task. In other words, one learns.

Some of the worst coders know a lot about one single programming language, usually Java. At the same time, they don't want to learn anything else. They are as proud of what they know, as they are of what they don't know. They invent all manner of ludicrous excuses to justify their knowledge. Python is for kids. C++ is a NASA Conspiracy. Go doesn't exist.

Franz Liszt, arguably the most celebrated pianist who ever lived, and composer of Un Sospiro, practised the piano daily for hours on end. While he possessed virtuosic ability, each day, he hoped to learn something new.

This is the only way to do anything. Forget what you know or don't know. Not only will you learn, but you might also learn something that has never before been known. This type of learning is called creativity.
