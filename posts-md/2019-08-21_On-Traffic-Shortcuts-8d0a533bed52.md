# On Traffic Shortcuts

### And why they should be abolished

Colombo Traffic is bad at the best of times. It is worse during the morning and evening office rush-hour. It is, perhaps, worst at the entrances and exits to the city centre.

Increasingly, many of the drivers in Colombo use Google Maps and other forms of navigation, a trend accented by Uber, PickMe and other taxi services. GPS powered navigation tends to provide some ingenious driving tips. A common suggestion is the "shortcut" that bypasses a main road.

But do shortcuts actually work?

### Freeways are good

Something good about a main road that is not crisscrossed by shortcuts is that it is effectively a"freeway". By "freeway", I mean that its two flows of traffic in opposite directions, don't interfere with each other.

### Collision Points are bad

On the other hand, the moment there is a shortcut bypassing a segment of a main road, "collision points" occur. By "collision points" I mean a point of the road where there are two or more flows of traffic coming in, from different directions. Unless some flows of traffic stop for the others, there can be collisions. We solve this collision problem by posting traffic lights, traffic police officers or roundabouts to control the traffic flow. However, these collision prevention tactics incur some overhead and slow down the traffic overall.

During rush-hour, most of the traffic is in either one or the other direction; Into the city in the morning, and out of the city in the evening. Hence, in many places, shortcut roads have been made "oneway".

Unfortunately, this doesn't solve the problem of collision points either, as you see from the diagram. The number of collision points is reduced from 5 to 3, but they still exist. More importantly, the collision points also become bottlenecks.

### Bottlenecks are worse

Suppose during evening rush hour, M vehicles were trying to get out of the city every minute, and N were trying to get in. Also suppose Mp vehicles used the shortcut, while M(1 — p) remained on the main road. At two of the collision points, we have Mp + N vehicles trying to get passed per minute, when without the shortcut we only had N. Hence, the shortcut actually slows down the traffic.

## What next?

At the best of times, traffic shortcuts have no benefit, and at the worst times significantly slow down traffic. Hence, we should abolish shortcuts. But how?

On some shortcut roads, one entrance is blocked disabling its ability to bypass the main road. However, this is highly disruptive, particularly to the residents on the road, and is usually restricted to short, private roads.

An alternative might be for navigation apps to be smarter, and factor in the well-being of the traffic ecosystem as a whole, instead of narrowly optimizing for their clients' benefit. In a world with increasing automated navigation, these problems converge anyway.
