# Fragile Employees vs Fragile Companies

In August 2015, the New York Times, published "Inside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace.". The following excerpt reasonably summarizes the whole:

>>> "Even as the company tests delivery by drone and ways to restock toilet paper at the push of a bathroom button, it is conducting a little-known experiment in how far it can push white-collar workers, redrawing the boundaries of what is acceptable. The company, founded and still run by Jeff Bezos, rejects many of the popular management bromides that other corporations at least pay lip service to and has instead designed what many workers call an intricate machine propelling them to achieve Mr. Bezos' ever-expanding ambitions. "This is a company that strives to do really big, innovative, groundbreaking things, and those things aren't easy," said Susan Harker, Amazon's top recruiter. "When you're shooting for the moon, the nature of the work is really challenging. For some people it doesn't work." "

The piece was seen by many as been a "dystopian expose". Jeff Bezos sent a memo to Amazon employees, including (among other things) the following rebuttals.

>>> "The NYT article prominently features anecdotes describing shockingly callous management practices, including people being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems. The article doesn't describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day."

>>> "The article goes further than reporting isolated anecdotes. It claims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard. Again, I don't recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you don't, either"

### Antifragilty by Layers

I have not worked at Amazon, and while I have heard many anecdotes from friends and colleagues on the pros and cons of Amazon Culture, I don't feel qualified to judge if the "little-known experiment in how far it can push white-collar workers" has succeeded or failed. However, it did remind me of this quote from Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder by Nasim Nicholas Taleb:

>>> "This chapter is about error, evolution, and antifragility, with a hitch: it is largely about the errors of others — the antifragility of some comes necessarily at the expense of the fragility of others. In a system, the sacrifices of some units — fragile units, that is, or people — are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole. The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that's what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate."

In the book, Taleb introduces antifragility as follows:

>>> "Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better"

The relationship between the fragility and antifragility of various layers of a system, is a common theme in the book. The key premise is that fragility at one layer, promotes Antifragility one level higher, and vice versa. For example, Taleb talks about how fragile start-ups makes for an antifragile start-up ecosystem in Silicon Valley, while conversely, how antifragile too-big-to-fail banks, led to a fragile banking system during the 2008 financial crisis.

### Antifragile Companies

The "Amazon Experiment" (For the rest of this note, I'll use the term "Amazon Experiment" to refer to the picture painted by the New York Times, and not necessarily reality) could be caricatured as "maximizing employee-layer fragility, to maximize company-layer antifragility". One could argue that if achieving the companies mission is the top-priority, then doing everything possible to maximize company-layer antifragility, which might necessarily involve maximizing employee-layer fragility. In this light, the stresses, pressures and "Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk."-type culture seems reasonable, even optimal. Through one lens, this almost sounds like to argument the NYT is trying to make.

However, I find this argument weak, for one simple reason: There are other ways of achieving company-layer antifragility. While overly stressing employees might work, why adopt a draconian strategy, when softer strategies might exist?

Two of my favorite company-layer antifragility strategies are Teams and (what I'd like to call) "Kicking fragility downstairs".

### Teams

Teams seek to balance competition with cooperation. Teams of employees working together to achieve common goals are more antifragile than individual employees who might be forced to compete unnecessarily with other employees. To frame this in "Antifragility-by-layers"-speak, we shelter all employees in a new layer known as a "Team" which is less fragile.

Now, in some cases, teams can be too antifragile, leading to the company as a whole becoming fragile. Often teams and broader sub-organizations become too powerful, political, and start behaving in ways that are counter to the company's overall interests. Sometimes the company consists of many such teams which are locked in machinations and mutual distrust.

Hence, some constraints are needed to ensure the right balance is reached. For example,

* Common Goals. Teams should have goals and missions which are closely aligned with the company's overall goals and mission. This is a top-down way of constraining what a team does to things that are acceptable to the company as a whole.

* Communication. While things like "mission" and long term "vision" are common across companies, and are communicated top-down, it's more efficient that shorter term strategies and tactics are framed at the grassroots level. However, these tactics must also be aligned across teams, and inter-team communication is vital for this.

* Small Teams. One obvious way to prevent antifragile teams that lead to fragile companies is to make sure that no team is too big. However, with many questions of "small is good", the challenge to make teams as small as possible, but not too small.

### Kicking fragility downstairs

An alternate approach is to move fragility down a level from employees to something else. But to what? The sometimes chastised adage "Move fast and break things" offers some clues.

In its most generous interpretation, "Move fast" simply means that employees can operate in a efficient manner, while minimizing time and resource wastage. A corollary of "Move fast" is "Fail fast" — or an environment where employees experiment, try things, understand what works and what does not, and move on to the next thing quickly. "Break things" implicitly implies an environment where an employee can break things without actually breaking things — or in other words, there are safeguards against the consequences of moving fast — experiment at low cost.

In other words, a "Move fast and break things" culture and environment, enables employees to be antifragile, by moving fragility down to the level of processes and experiments. In such a world, an employee can succeed by failing 99 times, and succeeding once. As opposed to a "Move slow, and don't break things" world, where they are fired for failing once.

### Concluding food for thought

Hence, there are some reasonable ways to mitigate Company-Employee Fragility tensions, without too much pain. Let me end with describing a tension one level higher.

The Herfindahl-Hershman Index (HHI) measures the level of inter-company competition in an industry. It's computed as follows: First, for every company in the industry, we compute its market share as a percentage; Second, the squares of these percentages are summed-up to give the index.The higher the HHI, the less competitive the industry. For example, an industry where one company has an absolute monopoly (i.e. a 100% market share), has an HHI of 10,000. An industry where two companies dominate equally (i.e. with 50% market shares each), has an HHI of 5000. A highly competitive market with 100 companies each with an equal market share of 1%, has an HHI of 100.

Many tech giants dominate their industries. For example, Google boasts nearly 80% of the Desktop Search, leading to that industry having an HHI in excess 6,000. Applying some of the principles discussed above, we might conclude that overly antifragile companies will lead to fragile industries. This is probably a much bigger fragility problem.
