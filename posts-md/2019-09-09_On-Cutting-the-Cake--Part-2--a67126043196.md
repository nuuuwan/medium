# On Cutting the Cake (Part 2)

### Day Zero Value

In On Cutting the Cake, I discussed the topic of splitting startup stock in general, and the principle of proportionality in particular:

>>> Any dividend or profit or gain should be proportional to investment share

>>> Any loss should also be proportional to investment share

Several of you expressed some concerns, that my recommendations would be unfair to founders, as opposed to investors. Several of you referred to my toy example:

>>> "We can fix this problem by giving Alice stock, not all at the beginning, but in instalments. In the beginning, she has zero shares, but by the end of the first year, she is awarded a total of 10%, possibly in monthly instalments."

In this follow-up to On Cutting the Cake, I want to address two of your concerns. Namely that,

* The scheme ignores value already built by the founder

* The founder has no shares at the beginning, and might loose control of the company

## "The scheme ignores value already built by the founder"

In my toy example, the founder Alice had already built a business with some value:

>>> Alice had built a small but stable business with annual revenues of Rs. 2M, from about 40 loyal customers. Her yearly costs, taxes, and other expenses were about Rs. 1M, and she paid herself the remaining Rs.1M as a salary.

So why did I recommend that Alice should have 0% ownership of the company at the beginning? Especially given that Alice had proved value?

My next point might be controversial, but is at the basis of my recommendation:

When we say "Alice had proved value", what we actually mean is that we are "predicting future value based on past value". And as with any prediction, this prediction is uncertain.

Now, what is the uncertainty (or variance, or "error-bars") of this prediction? To understand uncertainty, we would need to consider similar startups — or, to be precise, a statistically significant number of similar startups. Now, for any startup you might want to invest in, how many similar startups do you know? And know well? This is the problem. Each startup is unique, and, hence, it is almost impossible to make accurate predictions about the future.

Now, neither can we say that the value of this startup is zero. All we can say is that we can't say anything. Hence, we get around the problem of prediction by postpoing our decisions that need that prediction, until we have credible information.

Hence, as Alice adds value to the company by working (and providing credible information that Alice is indeed prepared to work, as opposed to running away with the investment), she earns stocks:

>>> In the beginning, she has zero shares, but by the end of the first year, she is awarded a total of 10%

Similarly, if the company proves value (more credible information), again, Alice earns more stock:

>>> What if, as projected in the best-case scenario, at the end of the first year, the company makes Rs. 2M in profit. Now, this will entitle Alice to a further Rs. 2M of shares, or another 20% (a "cliff"). Hence, in this best-case scenario, at the end of the first year, Bob will have 20% of the shares, and Alice 30%. Similarly, at the end of the 2nd year (Rs. 4M in profit + Rs. 1M in salary), Alice will have an 80% share in total.

Hence, I don't ignore value. I merely postpone decisions that need an accurate estimation of value, until I have this information.

## "The founder has no shares at the beginning, and might loose control of the company"

The founder is contractually entitled to receive instalments of stock on both 1) a time basis, and 2) on the company performing well (see above examples).

In our toy example, by the end of the first year, founder Alice has a majority of the shares:

>>> ...at the end of the first year, Bob will have 20% of the shares, and Alice 30%.

This majority increases with time:

>>> Similarly, at the end of the 2nd year (Rs. 4M in profit + Rs. 1M in salary), Alice will have an 80% share in total.

## Concluding thoughts

One (possibly contrarian) principle which most founders and many investors don't accept is that it is not possible to value startups on day zero of an investment. Many who do accept this point, still try to pretend that valuation is possible, because they don't see an alternative.

There is an alternative, and that is to postpone part of the stock split decision until more information is available. Contrarian perhaps, but quite simple.
