# On Ability

### Aphorisms

* Ability is a prediction of whether one is "able" to do something in the future.

* The prediction might be binary ("I am able" or "I am not able"), or probabilistic ("There's a fifty-fifty chance than I'm able")

* Confidence is the ratio between what one thinks one can do, and what one can do. If the proportion is greater than one, one is "over-confident".

* Just as we can talk about future ability, we can also talk about the past ("I was able to..."). But what usually matters is "present" ability ("I am able...").

* Both past and future are misleading. We might not be (or be) able to do in the future, what we did (or did not) in the past.

* The only way of knowing for sure, if one is able to do something, is to just do it. Now.
