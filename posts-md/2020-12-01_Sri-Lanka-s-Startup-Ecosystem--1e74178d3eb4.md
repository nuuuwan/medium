### Startups in Sri Lanka

# Sri Lanka's Startup Ecosystem — 2020 December

### A Visualization

Can we visualise every Startup in Sri Lanka in a single picture? Read on to find out.

## The Data Source

Startup SL is a platform run by ICTA (Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka) that claims to help startups to get access to accreditation, finance, partnerships and markets. It lists 335 startups, along with some interesting information about them, including category, funding stage and startup stage, along with the founders' contact details.

In this article, I visualize these startups in various ways, in an attempt to get a summary view of Sri Lanka's Startup Ecosystem.

### Important Caveats

* The listing on Startup SL might not be exhaustive. There are interesting and valuable startups, known to me, that are not listed here.

* Much of the information is self-reported by the startups. Some of it, particularly regarding funding, looks suspect.

## The Big Picture

In this "StartupScape", I group 335 startups by category (as reported on Startup SL). Each Startup assigns itself to up to three (out of 43 possible) categories. Hence some startups appear in multiple boxes.

This Big Picture is dominated by IT Products and Services, followed by E-Commerce, Mobile Apps, Education and Digital Marketing. This pattern continues as we look at finer cuts of startups.

## Startups by "Startup" Stage

### Ideation

Not all startups, even within the same category, are the same. The earliest startups consist of a set of founders (or sometimes even a single founder) brainstorming an idea. They believe that the idea might have potential. We call this the "Ideation" stage.

### Traction

Once the founders have had time to test their idea, and it gains some traction, the Startup enters the "Traction" stage.

If we exclude the 74 startups in "Ideation", our StartupScape (with 261 remaining startups) looks like this.

### Break-Even

"Break-Even" is when a business total revenue is approximately equal to its costs. Hence, it makes neither profit nor loss — an important milestone for any startup because it proves that its net value is at least neutral.

Startup SL has 131 startups at Break-Even or beyond.

### Profit

Once revenues start exceeding costs, startups enter a "Profit" stage. Startup SL has 76 startups at Break-Even or beyond.

[Note, this information is self-reported by the startups. I can't guarantee that these startups are profitable.]

### Scaling

Startups usually use the term "growing" to describe that they are trying to do what they are doing a bit better. Hence, growth is generally considered additive. "Scaling" on the other hand is multiplicative.

Startup SL has 37 startups at Scaling or beyond.

### Steady

Finally, a startup reaches a "steady-state" where it more-or-less starts to do the same thing. By this stage, a startup is probably no-longer a startup. It is also debated if "stable" is a good state for any business, as it should be looking to innovate. Nevertheless, "Stable" is the final startup stage in Startup SL's classification.

Startup SL has eight startups at Stable.

## Startups by Funding Stage

### Pre-Seed

Funding can be used to categorize a startup's evolution. Founders initially fund most startups, and possibly their close family, friends and other supporters. This type of funding is known as "Pre-seed" funding. Pre-seed funding is often unofficial, and some funders don't take a share of the companies equity.

### Seed

"Seed" funding is the first round of "official" funding, where the funders take an equity stake in the company.

Startup SL has 152 startups at Seed or beyond.

### Angel

The term "Angel investor" or "Angel" refers to a professional investor who tends to invest in risky ventures like early stage startups.

Startup SL has 83 startups at Angel or beyond.

### Series A

Startups seek "Series A" funding once they have proved their idea, gained some traction, and have a longer-term plan for profitability. However, this is an arbitrary definition — and we will see later if this holds for Startup SL's list.

Startup SL has 47 startups at Series A or beyond.

### Series B

In a "Series B", startups seek even more profitability and larger scale. In addition to the investment, investors often help Startup with expanding markets and new partnerships. Again, this definition is somewhat arbitrary. An alternative description of "Series B" could be "The round after Series A". In this way, there could be "Series C", "Series D", and even beyond (though Startup SL's classification ends with "B").

Startup SL has 22 startups at Series A or beyond.

### Venture Capital

The term "Venture Capital" funding tends to overlap with all the post-pre-seed stages. However, it is usually different in that "Venture Capital" funding tends to come from Venture Capital firms, as opposed to individual investors.

Startup SL has 20 startups at Venture Capital or beyond.

### Mezzanine

Mezzanine financing usually consists of a combination of investments and loans and often precedes an Initial Public Offering. Often startups have specific projects they want to spend the funds on, often with the goal in optimizing their public offering value.

Startup SL has eight startups at Venture Capital or beyond.

### Initial Public Offering

At an Initial Public Offering, the Startup's shares are offered for sale in a Public Stock Market. And hence, it has access to funding from the public.

Startup SL has two startups at Venture Capital or beyond.

## Startup Stage vs Funding Stage

A startup's "Startup Stage" and "Funding Stage" are correlated. Here is a visualization of this correlation, for the startups on Startup SL.

This might be clearer:

Like most startup ecosystems, most startups listed on Startup SL are in the Ideation or Traction stage. Few get beyond this stage.

Also there is a (very) weak correlation positive between the startup stage and funding, with many outlyers and exceptions (though some might be self-reporting errors).

## Concluding Thoughts

Please heed the caveats. The underlying data seems approximate at best. However, with some improvements to data quality and coverage, analyses of this type are likely to be useful.
