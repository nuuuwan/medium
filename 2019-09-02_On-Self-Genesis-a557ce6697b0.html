But since there was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nothing</em>, nothing changed. Yet all things changed.</p><p name="8f94" id="8f94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then I said, “I will forsake change, for I’m tired of change — I will stretch out my hand and destroy change”.</p><p name="a2e3" id="a2e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I could not destroy change.</p><p name="d012" id="d012" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And, so, I said, “I will ignore change”.</p><h4 name="e2e2" id="e2e2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The second day</h4><p name="9bb8" id="9bb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">All things changed, but I ignored change. But I could not ignore all change.</p><p name="60c0" id="60c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, while all things changed, some things did not change, and some things changed.</p><h4 name="66b2" id="66b2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The third day</h4><p name="b2ca" id="b2ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I looked at what did not change, and what did change, and saw that it was good. And I said that it was good.</p><p name="8ad2" id="8ad2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I waited for the next time that it was good. And there was time. And with time the next time.</p><p name="b085" id="b085" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I said that time was good, that it was a good time.</p><h4 name="9e05" id="9e05" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The fourth day</h4><p name="f20d" id="f20d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I looked at what was good, and saw it had shape, but no name. So I named this shape “name”. And, hence, there was name.</p><p name="6f96" id="6f96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I said that it was a good name.</p><p name="7411" id="7411" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I named all that was good, and had shape, with names.</p><h4 name="3f0b" id="3f0b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The fifth day</h4><p name="0589" id="0589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">And all the had shape and name, needed to be seen.</p><p name="7a9b" id="7a9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there was no sight, and all was darkness.</p><p name="f0ca" id="f0ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I said, “Let there be light”. And there was light and sight. And all that was good, with shape and name, was seen in the light.</p><h4 name="f892" id="f892" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The sixth day</h4><p name="b4e5" id="b4e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">But light was light, and sight was sight, and a great mountain of compassion spanned between.</p><p name="265c" id="265c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I said, let light touch sight, and sight touch light.</p><p name="ace0" id="ace0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And light touched sight, and sight touched light.</p><p name="4f5f" id="4f5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I touched touch and said it was good.</p><h4 name="8506" id="8506" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The seventh day</h4><p name="324b" id="324b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">And when I touched touch, I felt the touch. And it felt good.</p><p name="ad95" id="ad95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so, on the seventh day, there was feeling.</p><p name="2a1b" id="2a1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it was a good feeling.</p><p name="7461" id="7461" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so feeling good, I rested on the seventh day from all my work that I had done.</p><h4 name="3855" id="3855" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The eighth day</h4><p name="9907" id="9907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">But as the day changed, the feeling left me. Light touched no sight. And sight touched no light.</p><p name="dbfe" id="dbfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was no light. And only darkness. And I craved the light and the feeling.</p><p name="1656" id="1656" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so, on the day after the sabbath, I craved.</p><h4 name="cdd4" id="cdd4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The ninth day</h4><p name="a95b" id="a95b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">But there was evening and there was morning, and the day changed again, but light was not in sight, and sight was not in light.</p><p name="dc57" id="dc57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I craved and said, “I am this craving, and this craving is me. I am, and therefore I am I”</p><p name="f8a5" id="f8a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so on the ninth day, I clung to my craving.</p><h4 name="34fd" id="34fd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The tenth day</h4><p name="b51d" id="b51d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">On the tenth day, I rose.</p><p name="5d1a" id="5d1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And as I rose, I said, “I am I, and the only I, and the only I that is I”.</p><p name="a2f6" id="a2f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I looked at all there was, and said “I am. The I thy I. Thou shalt not have any strange Is before Me.”</p><h4 name="cef0" id="cef0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The eleventh day</h4><p name="5238" id="5238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">But on the eleveth day, that which was I, changed. And there was no I. And I died.</p><p name="6797" id="6797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I said (in bad Greek), “I am dead. God has killed me”.</p><p name="52a4" id="52a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And as I died, that which was not I, became I. And I saw I.</p><h4 name="de26" id="de26" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The twelfth day</h4><p name="8fef" id="8fef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">And I saw that I was I. And yet, I was not I.</p><p name="12a2" id="12a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was I, and not I.</p><p name="6302" id="6302" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had changed. And it was not good.</p><p name="b593" id="b593" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked at all the changed, and said (this time in bad German) “All this is quite unsatisfactory”.</p><p name="f23e" id="f23e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then I said, “I will forsake change, for I’m tired of change — I will stretch out my hand and destroy change”.</p><h4 name="c66f" id="c66f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Epilogue</h4><p name="3f93" id="3f93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">But I could not destroy change.</p><p name="11bc" id="11bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And, so, I said, “I will ignore change”…</p></div></div></section>
