See also </em><a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/digitalising-identity-7dc1ccb170f4" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/digitalising-identity-7dc1ccb170f4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Part I</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.]</em></p><h3 name="5e9f" id="5e9f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Identity</h3><p name="f635" id="f635" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What is our “identity”? It is who we are. It is the “collection of things” that “make us”. Or the information that “defines us”. Everything from our DNA to our physical appearance, to our memories. To our ethnic, religious, cultural, political and social affiliations. They are all part of our identity.</p><p name="7d42" id="7d42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This information can be encoded as digital data. For example, our DNA could be sequenced. And this sequence could be digitally represented. We could take a photo of our face, and represent it as a “bit map”. We could record our voice and store it as an mp3 file. Hence, in all these various ways, an increasing proportion of our identity is “digitised”. Into a “digital form”.</p><p name="c0de" id="c0de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The digitisation of identity has led to a vast digital industry. Offering various goods and services based on identity. Facebook lets you interact with the digital identities of people and businesses. Socially, but also economically and socially. LinkedIn hosts a subset of your identity that reflects your employment record. And helps you find jobs, network professionally, and gloat over colleagues with less impressive profiles. Google hosts various parts of your identity for free. In the form of search history, emails, and calendar events. Convenient digital alternatives to public libraries, snail mail, and physical diaries. Which Google effectively “sells” for vast amounts of ad revenue.</p><h3 name="7403" id="7403" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Ownership</h3><p name="4c93" id="4c93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Intuitively, we might believe that we “own” our identities. Digital and Analog. Online and Offline. But ownership is a relative concept. Relative to enforcement. Without enforcement, ownership is meaningless.</p><p name="b619" id="b619" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In turn, enforcement is also relative. Relative to power. In any society, the powers-that-be determine what enforcement and ownership mean.</p><p name="f520" id="f520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, a government might deem that all the phone records of its citizens are its property. And shady civil servants might be eavesdropping on our most intimate conversations. Similarly, a multi-national corporation might deem it owns “all your photos” because its “terms of conditions say so”. And because you have no chance of winning in court. Even if the TOC did not say so.</p><p name="838d" id="838d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which definition of ownership you believe to be “right”, depends on your political beliefs. If you are a communist, you might believe that no ownership should be private. If you are a capitalist, you might believe that all should be. On identity, there are even deeper nuances. Some capitalists believe that the original owner should always own private identity data. Others believe that it might be bought and sold.</p><h3 name="a89f" id="a89f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Large and Small Rebellions</h3><p name="e5e4" id="e5e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">No political ideology is absolutely good or bad. Their relative goodness or badness depends on their effects. For example, if ownership and its enforcement result in extreme inequalities, people suffer. And suffering people rebel. And large rebellions lead to large-scale pain and destruction.</p><p name="e6f2" id="e6f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not all ownership-driven rebellions are outwardly political. If you have had a severe illness, and your insurance provider knows this, your premium might be expensive. Exorbitantly so. One might argue that this is rational, even “fair”. But it all sick people were priced out, medical insurance would be meaningless. Hence, regulations that ban higher premiums for “pre-existing conditions” are good all round. For both the patient and the provider. Other regulation protects against “unethical” sharing of data. For example, an medical insurer should not buy credit card history from a bank. In these examples, the principle is the same. Extreme asymmetries and inequalities in access to data lead to problems. And potential rebellions.</p><p name="da43" id="da43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Large rebellions can be prevented. Via small rebellions. Whenever the existence or potential for extreme asymmetries and inequalities are detected, there should be some “letting-off of steam”. The asymmetries and inequalities must be reduced. This might cause some short term pain, but it is better in the long term. For example, regulating insurers might dent their profits in the short term, but is better for both patients and providers in the long term.</p><p name="d54a" id="d54a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When dealing with asymmetries and inequalities in digital identity, small-scale rebellions come in the form of introducing legislation. Usually, in the form of data protection laws.</p><figure name="f1e7" id="f1e7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ya_viQAjsoKpTb7lKZMk3w.png" data-width="1040" data-height="620" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ya_viQAjsoKpTb7lKZMk3w.png"></figure><h3 name="a659" id="a659" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Horror Stories</h3><p name="02ab" id="02ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Recently, I heard a horror story.</p><p name="c272" id="c272" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A reputable Sri Lankan bank emailed a spreadsheet to a data analytics firm. The spreadsheet contained thousands of rows of client credit card information. Including the card numbers, the client names, and transaction history. The emailing happened via an unsecured email connection. Employees of the data analytics firm had full access to all the data.</p><p name="8960" id="8960" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the real horror of this story is that, all this was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not illegal</em>. We don’t have data protection laws that prevent such actions. And as long as this is the case, more and more of this will happen.</p><p name="8c93" id="8c93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this is not a Sri Lankan phenomenon. Silicon Valley is probably the best example of a complete breakdown. Of Digital Identity and Ownership.</p><p name="5629" id="5629" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like in Sri Lanka, there is almost no protection of personal data, when it comes to large tech companies. Like Google and Facebook. Security breaches and hacks do happen from time to time. But the real damage comes in the form of huge asymmetries and inequalities of data ownership. Given the data ownership advantage large tech companies have, they have an asymmetric power in profiteering from data. As a result, no other businesses can compete with these behemoths. This data inequality leads to income inequality and wealth inequality. And also inequalities in political and social power and dignity. San Francisco might be home to some of the world’s wealthiest people. But it has also become the homelessness capital of the world.</p><figure name="8eb3" id="8eb3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZMx9I7qNKIwAV-7pQRaCdg.jpeg" data-width="840" data-height="473" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZMx9I7qNKIwAV-7pQRaCdg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">San Francisco Homeless (Source: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-francisco-homeless-count-increase-20190709-story.html" data-href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-francisco-homeless-count-increase-20190709-story.html" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LA Times</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 name="80c8" id="80c8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">What to do?</h3><p name="cdad" id="cdad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If Sri Lanka can learn anything from Silicon Valley, it is that Digital Identity in particular, and data in general, needs protection. What are some good fundamentals to follow?</p><p name="b6b1" id="b6b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem with fundamentals is that no fundamental is perfect. And if you believe in the perfection of fundamentals, you become a fundamentalist. Usually leading to a lot of pain for you and others.</p><p name="97b9" id="97b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, I’m not a fan of many fundamentalist views of data, its ownership and its protection. Including communist and capitalist views. The problem with these fundamentals is that they are too broad and vague. And for every example of their success, there are as many failures.</p><p name="f612" id="f612" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are better fundamentals. For example,</p><ul class="postList"><li name="98cc" id="98cc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Minimalism</strong>. It’s better to concentrate as much data ownership with individuals. Make sure that larger entities like states and corporations have a minimal set of information they need to do their job.</li><li name="d35d" id="d35d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Equity</strong>. Whenever a small number of players have an asymmetrically large proportion of data, the industry suffers. The small amount of players will prosper in the short term, but everyone loses in the long run. Hence, small rebellions that remove inequities will prevent large rebellions that destroy industries.</li></ul><p name="58fb" id="58fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">The next step is a set of small rebellions. That might cause a small amount of pain. But is better in the long term. Ones based on minimalism and equality. That will make sure our digital identities are protected.</p></div></div></section>
