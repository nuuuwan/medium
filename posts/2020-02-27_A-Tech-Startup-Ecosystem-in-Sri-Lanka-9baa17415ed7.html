Complete with funding, market reach, connections, talent, experience and knowledge. But invariably, the best startup entrepreneurs tend to come from “not-so-nice places”. Often places with economic hardship, war and persecution.</blockquote><blockquote name="f782" id="f782" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Thus, often a startup-hub is not just one place. But two places: the nice place and the not-so-nice-place. The former is the “official startup hub”. While the latter is where many of the entrepreneurs come from.</strong></blockquote><figure name="55d9" id="55d9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qgZZ--S3Hhzq8G3kTwwvPg.png" data-width="720" data-height="400" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qgZZ--S3Hhzq8G3kTwwvPg.png"></figure><p name="e376" id="e376" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The answer to “Can we build a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka?” depends on two questions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="f7e4" id="f7e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Can Sri Lanka be a “Nice (enough) Place” to support a Startup Hub?</li><li name="48fa" id="48fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Does Sri Lanka have sources of “Not-so-nice Places” that can supply entrepreneurs?</li></ol><h3 name="85b1" id="85b1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Question 1: Can Sri Lanka be a “Nice (enough) Place” to support a Startup Hub?</h3><blockquote name="eb0f" id="eb0f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3">The ideal tech startup ecosystem is a “support system”. It has everything a startup needs. Funding is available at a reasonable cost. And it has connections to markets and economies.</blockquote><blockquote name="774d" id="774d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Thus, the ideal tech startup ecosystem becomes a magnet for talent. Not only new entrepreneurs looking for their first wins. But also experienced veterans. Seasoned entrepreneurs who have succeeded elsewhere, often many times. “Knowledge organisations” like universities and research groups, join these people. (<a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" target="_blank">Part I</a>)</blockquote><p name="9ad5" id="9ad5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Does Sri Lanka have adequate funding? Do we have access to markets and economies? Do we have decent “knowledge organisations”?</strong></p><p name="3edf" id="3edf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most common answer I’ve heard is:</p><blockquote name="890c" id="890c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Yes, but not enough. We could do better.</blockquote><p name="ed62" id="ed62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">For example, there is a nascent angel investor community in Sri Lanka. Which is good. But too often, startups need to give up a too larger share of their business for a too smaller amount of funding. Hence, not good enough. Similarly, Sri Lanka has access to large markets, especially in South and East Asia. Which is good. But at the same time has various problems with brand, reputation, access and exposure. Hence, again, not good enough. The same probably applies to “Knowledge Organisations” and other factors.</p><p name="88d3" id="88d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, unsurprisingly, many people have been trying to improve these factors. From “not good enough” to “better”. Presumably, these people believe that the answer to “Can Sri Lanka be a “Nice (enough) Place” to support a Startup Hub?” is yes. And they might be right.</p><p name="d394" id="d394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then what is the problem?</p><p name="5d83" id="5d83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is that most people “with the good of Sri Lankan Startups at heart”, have over-focussed on “Can Sri Lanka be a “Nice (enough) Place”. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">And completely ignored the second question: “Does Sri Lanka have sources of “Not-so-nice Places” that can supply entrepreneurs?”</strong></p><h3 name="077d" id="077d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Question 2: Does Sri Lanka have sources of “Not-so-nice Places” that can supply entrepreneurs?</h3><p name="34ad" id="34ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The Israeli Entrepreneur-turned Early Stage Investor (who inspired these articles — see <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Part I</a>), visited Sri Lanka to invest in, not one startup, but a bucket of startups. The point of a bucket was to “diversify” the portfolio. Since most startups only have a small chance of success, the only wise investment is a diversified one.</p><p name="db72" id="db72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem with the Sri Lankan Startup Ecosystem was that there weren’t enough startups to fill a bucket. An investor could find one or two potentially promising startups. But not enough to build a diverse portfolio. Hence, any investor had one of two options:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="31d9" id="31d9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Leave Sri Lanka, and invest somewhere else. Like the Israeli did.</li><li name="926b" id="926b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pass on the risk to the entrepreneurs, by offering little funding for a lot of shares. Like most Sri Lankan angels do.</li></ol><p name="f9cf" id="f9cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Now you might ask, why can’t Sri Lankan startups be Part of some bigger bucket. Like Indian startups. This is a fair point. And many investors do invest in Sri Lanka as Part of a larger South Asian or Asian bucket. However, many don’t. Because investing in another country involves some non-trivial fixed costs. And the supply in Sri Lanka is a small fraction of giant India.</p><p name="f395" id="f395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The cause of this supply problem is that Sri Lanka has no “Not-so-nice-Places”. Hence, the solution lies in “building” such places.</p><h3 name="76e2" id="76e2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What to do?</h3><p name="7322" id="7322" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Part I</a>, I gave several examples of “Nice” Startup Hubs, and their corresponding “Not So Nice” sources of entrepreneurs. Let’s see what Sri Lanka might learn from these.</p><h4 name="519b" id="519b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Singapore and Incentives</h4><blockquote name="9bc9" id="9bc9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">Singapore’s “not-so-niceness” comes from its government. Which is, on paper, democratic. But in many ways autocratic. There is a significant amount of pressure applied to all manner of institutions, from universities to companies, to innovate. Particularly technology. (<a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" target="_blank">Part I</a>)</blockquote><p name="23a3" id="23a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What if the Sri Lankan government creates incentives for universities and companies to drive more innovation? For example, through special funding and other financial incentives?</p><p name="962d" id="962d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And what if innovation is engrained into work culture? For example, what if university professors are not evaluated on publications in esoteric journals, but on the FDI their research helps bring in?</p><p name="db6d" id="db6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, there are pros and cons to these measures. But this is what Singapore does. And it has undoubtedly yielded them some pros.</p><h4 name="9801" id="9801" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Silicon Valley (SV) and Immigration</h4><blockquote name="4cc3" id="4cc3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">Silicon value has all the “nice” properties of a startup hub, from almost infinite funding to broad market reach. However, a disproportionate number of successful SV startups have been founded by immigrants from “not-so-nice-places”. (<a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" target="_blank">Part I</a>)</blockquote><p name="a8f5" id="a8f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The main factor that has driven SV’s success is that it has been a magnet for global talent. A simple solution to Sri Lanka’s entrepreneur (and general labour) shortage would be to make immigration easier. Particularly from South and East Asia.</p><p name="3cc9" id="3cc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, while SV has been generally positive for the world and its entrepreneurs, it has been hugely detrimental for Native Californians. Many were “priced out” and had to leave their homes for other parts of the country. Similarly, if Indians and Indonesians throng to Colombo and other parts of the country, many “Native” Sri Lankans will suffer. For all sorts of reasons.</p><p name="3371" id="3371" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hence, this whole discussion has a general caveat: Do we want a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka? Because it will involve breaking some eggs.</strong></p><h4 name="7902" id="7902" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Beijing/Shanghai and “Internal Immigration”</h4><p name="efcc" id="efcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A large proportion of Colombo’s “Startups” founded by rich kids with rich dads. Because being a “founder” is cool. Because you can wear hip clothes. And attend “events”. These Pseudo-Startups are a complete waste of time. And I’ve learnt to avoid these like the plague.</p><p name="b20e" id="b20e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In contrast, a lot of meaningful tech startups have emerged from other parts of the country. Other towns like Galle, Jaffna and Kurunegala. And even suburbs of Colombo — disconnected from the Pseudo-Startup hype.</p><p name="7aec" id="7aec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By “Internal Immigration”, I don’t mean entrepreneurs coming to Colombo. But investors and marketers exploring other parts of the country. Similarly, the government could consider investing in such places. As well as incentivising their schools and universities.</p><h4 name="5a08" id="5a08" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tel-Aviv and “Intimidation”</h4><p name="d86e" id="d86e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The “Island Culture” is very much a part of Sri Lanka. Food and shelter are generally (if not necessarily excellent) almost always sufficient. Relaxation and leisure usually take precedence over the stresses of hard work. Weekends and holidays are valued over “work days”. Hence, in some ways “Sri Lankan Culture” and “Entrepreneurship” are a contradiction in terms.</p><p name="98a8" id="98a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In contrast, many Startup Hubs are driven by threats and intimidation. For example, in <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/a-tech-startup-ecosystem-in-sri-lanka-144de8c96aa0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Part I</a>, I described Tel-Aviv as follows:</p><blockquote name="2227" id="2227" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Israel’s “not-so-niceness” derives, not from poverty, but from geopolitics and history. Israel’s neighbours want to blow it off the face of the earth. To this end, they have waged many wars. Both military and “diplomatic”. While on the surface Israel might have the “niceness” of a developed country, there is a constant “not-so-nice” threat of destruction. This has driven unparalleled development. Particularly in defence and security technology.</blockquote><p name="eaf6" id="eaf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Does Sri Lanka have “threats” that might be a source of motivation?</strong></p><p name="1a56" id="1a56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Several come to mind. But Climate Change is my favourite.</p><p name="a47d" id="a47d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Hot and Humid” countries like Sri Lanka are particularly vulnerable from rising temperatures. 35 degrees with 100% humidity can be fatal for humans. And such numbers of increasingly more common in many parts of the Island. Rising sea and river levels, and the resulting floods are also a threat to some of the most densely populated areas. Finally, poor air quality is causing a spike in asthma and respiratory disease. Particularly in children.</p><p name="3cfb" id="3cfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if Sri Lanka can become the leader in Climate Change Tech?</p><h3 name="28d5" id="28d5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Thoughts</h3><p name="4266" id="4266" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Should we build a Tech Startup Ecosystem in Sri Lanka?</p><p name="e01a" id="e01a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are arguments both ways. Just as Native Californians have suffered from Silicon Valley, the construction process will involve breaking some eggs.</p><p name="193a" id="193a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answer might very well be “No”.</p><p name="be06" id="be06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But if we decide “Yes”, then we should set about solving the problem intelligently.</strong></p><p name="0093" id="0093" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So far, those who have decided yes are only focussing on “Can Sri Lanka be a “Nice (enough) Place” to support a Startup Hub?”. And are ignoring “Does Sri Lanka have sources of “Not-so-nice Places” that can supply entrepreneurs?”.</p><p name="cf8a" id="cf8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Without a good answer to the latter, the pursing the former is a waste of time.</p></div></div></section>
