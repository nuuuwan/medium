For this reason, within the pre-1977* FPTP system, certain electorates (e.g. Colombo-Central and Nuwara-Eliya), deemed ethnically diverse, were assigned multiple members. Hence, FPTP was adapted to ensure more representativeness and, in this way, making the overall system (a little) more like PR.</p><figure name="c612" id="c612" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*t6RQ3T6d4idAIPG5HNo7Mg.png" data-width="480" data-height="933" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*t6RQ3T6d4idAIPG5HNo7Mg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gerrymandering</a></figcaption></figure><p name="a14c" id="a14c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[*By pre-1977, I actually mean “Up to and including 1977]</em></p><h3 name="4e50" id="4e50" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Proportional Representation (PR)</h3><p name="5f2a" id="5f2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Under PR, the number of representatives elected was proportional to the number of votes received. Since (most of the) the pre-1977 electorates had only one member, and since it was not possible to “proportion” one member into “fractions”, the concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_districts_of_Sri_Lanka" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_districts_of_Sri_Lanka" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">electoral districts</a>” was introduced. An electoral district (ED) is a “super-electorate” with multiple seats. Each party wins a number of seats proportional to the number of votes it wins in the ED.</p><p name="e367" id="e367" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the November 2020 Parliamentary Election, 12 Seats were assigned to the Kandy electoral District. The SLPP won 8 seats after winning 59% of the vote, while the SJB won 4 with 29% of the vote. If we used FPTP, the SLPP would have won all the seats in Kandy, having come top in all electorates.</p><figure name="8346" id="8346" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*k8xngiO7ne4xSFnI7y_4pQ.png" data-width="1938" data-height="978" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k8xngiO7ne4xSFnI7y_4pQ.png"></figure><h4 name="f94b" id="f94b" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“Working Majorities”</h4><p name="5487" id="5487" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">PR also has its problems. In 5 of the 8 Parliamentary Elections since 1977, the party with the most seats failed to win a majority in parliament and sought smaller parties’ support, often after dubious rounds of horse-trading. Hence, some claim that PR makes it difficult to form “working majorities”.</p><figure name="2cc2" id="2cc2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*89YYUeEAbKrMi-DI6x9RqQ.png" data-width="2198" data-height="1022" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*89YYUeEAbKrMi-DI6x9RqQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections (after 1977) — Seats won by Winning Party</figcaption></figure><p name="8057" id="8057" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To me, this argument is weak. A parliament should be representative of the people, and if no party has the support of a majority of the population, none should enjoy a majority in parliament. More empirically, many countries (including many successful democracies) have “weak parties” forced to form coalitions with other weak parties. Often, weak parties lead to strong democracy — and vice versa.</p><p name="50a7" id="50a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, there is a second, stronger argument.</p><h4 name="ea67" id="ea67" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Weakening the Voter-Representative Link</h4><figure name="6033" id="6033" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gWnwWVOvBhvSk9TiUT2MYg.png" data-width="1852" data-height="1236" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gWnwWVOvBhvSk9TiUT2MYg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election — Page 1 of 25 page listing candidates contesting the Colombo Electoral District</figcaption></figure><p name="756c" id="756c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Consider my home ED, Colombo. In 2020, Colombo elected 19 MPs. Each party and independent group could nominate up to 22 candidates. With over 40 parties and groups contesting, over 800 candidates were contesting Colombo. It is almost impossible for the ordinary voter (myself included) to get one’s head around so many candidates. Voters either end up voting for a few candidates with ED spanning brands and bases (E.g. Ranil Wickramasinghe in Colombo, Mahinda Rajapakse in Kurunegala, Chandrika Bandaranaike in Gampaha, etc.) or else vote for only a party and no candidate.</p><figure name="34cd" id="34cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nuuuwan/status/1291404461580025856"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><figcaption class="imageCaption">2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election — Borella Results</figcaption></figure><p name="e5b4" id="e5b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It also made it impossible for smaller, more local parties to contest elections. Suppose I wanted to represent my home electorate of Borella. In 2020, the SJB came top in the Borella electorate with 20K votes. Hence, under FPTP, just 20K votes would have won me my home seat. However, under PR, since candidates and parties need to compete across the vast electoral district, spanning about 1.7M voters, a significantly larger number of votes are needed. The JBB, which won a single seat in Colombo, received 67K votes, marginally above the 5% cut-off (60K votes) to make a party eligible for seats.</p><p name="9c82" id="9c82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, PR shifts representation from concrete candidates to abstract (and especially large) parties. It becomes difficult for voters to hold their representatives accountable and for the said representatives to feel accountable towards their voters. The link between voter and representative is weakened or even broken. Small parties have no choice but to join larger parties in (often disadvantageous) collisions.</p><h3 name="d3f9" id="d3f9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Mixed Options</h3><p name="1605" id="1605" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In summary, FPTP can result in <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">unrepresentativeness</strong>, while PR can <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">weaken the Voter-Representative Link</strong>.</p><p name="ec6f" id="ec6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can there be some compromise?

Can we have a system that is both representative and where the link between voter and representative is maintained?</p><p name="df4a" id="df4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are several candidate solutions — none perfect. Here are three popular options.</p><h3 name="7421" id="7421" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Option 1: Mixed Member Majoritarian (MMM)</h3><p name="ea33" id="ea33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_voting" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_voting" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mixed Member Majoritarian</a> (MMM) system, a proportion of the seats are allocated to FPTP and the remainder to PR.</p><p name="0932" id="0932" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider the 2020 Parliamentary Election and the Kandy ED, which was assigned 12 seats. We could split these 12 seats 50%/50%, 6 to FPTP and 6 to PR. Since the SLPP won all the Kandy Electorates, it would get all 6 FPTP seats. If the remaining 6 PR seats were divided, the SLPP would win four and the SJB 2. The final result would be ten seats to the SLPP and two seats to the SJB.</p><figure name="97ca" id="97ca" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*brgsYAh-JGHB2BA2ZrHxng.png" data-width="1934" data-height="990" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*brgsYAh-JGHB2BA2ZrHxng.png"></figure><p name="6c2e" id="6c2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While more “unrepresentative” than pure PR, MMM is less “unrepresentative” than pure FPTP.</p><p name="bcfd" id="bcfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">MMM is used for Parliamentary Elections in many countries, and the FTPT/PR ratio tends to vary significantly.

However, it has the problem of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhang_seat" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhang_seat" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Overhang seats</a>”, where one party wins more FPTP seats than it would win under pure PR.</p><p name="ba52" id="ba52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Sri_Lankan_parliamentary_election" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Sri_Lankan_parliamentary_election" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2001</a> election. The Colombo ED had 20 seats, of which the UNP, UPFA and JHU won 9, 8 and 3, respectively. Of the 15 electorates, the UPFA and UNP won 9 and 6, respectively. If we assigned seats according to MMPR with an FPTP-PR ratio of 15–5 (75%-25%), then to achieve the same result as pure PR, we would need to assign the UNP and the JHU 3 seats each take-away one seat from the UPFA.</p><p name="6413" id="6413" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In practice, one of two solutions is applied to the overhang problem.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f433" id="f433" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The first is to <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">ignore the overhang</strong>. For example, the 5 PR seats might be assigned 3 and 2 to the UNP and JHU, respectively, in our example. The disadvantage of this approach is imperfect proportionality, and hence some “unrepresentativeness”. In this example, the unrepresentativeness favours the UPFA against the JHU.</li><li name="849c" id="849c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The second is to <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">add more seats</strong> to enable proportionality. For example, if Colombo had 23 seats, the PR assignment would be 10, 9 and 4 to the UNP, UPFA and JHU. After the 15 FPTP seats are assigned, the remaining 8 PR seats can be assigned 4 and 4 to the UNP and JHU, resulting in a match with perfect PR. The downside of this approach is that adding seats might result in parliament having a variable number of members. Also, adding seats to Colombo would mean that seats would have to be added to other EDs to ensure overall representativeness.</li></ul><h3 name="4138" id="4138" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Option 3: Smaller EDs</h3><p name="c2f2" id="c2f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The weaker link between voters and representatives under PR is worst in large EDs like Colombo and Gampaha, with 18 and 19 seats respectively, and a correspondingly large number of candidates per party and group.</p><p name="e973" id="e973" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is less problematic in a smaller ED like Trincomalee, with only four seats. With fewer electorates and fewer candidates, the connection between voter and representative is stronger than a larger ED.</p><figure name="7836" id="7836" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*wgVD6rWxz3SCWo6Sqob5ZA.png" data-width="990" data-height="1344" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wgVD6rWxz3SCWo6Sqob5ZA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary Election — Page 1 of 3 page listing candidates contesting the Trincomalee Electoral District</figcaption></figure><p name="0b78" id="0b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We can achieve the same effect in a large ED like Colombo by splitting it into smaller EDs. For example, the 19 seats could be split across five smaller EDs, with a maximum of 4 seats each.</p><p name="7fc2" id="7fc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While “Smaller Electoral Districts” is not strictly a mixed option and not referred to as one, I listed it here for the following reason: FPTP is an “extreme case” of PR where each electoral district has exactly one seat. General PR puts no limit on the size of the ED. Hence, PR with “Smaller EDs” is somewhere between FPTP and general PR.</p><p name="8056" id="8056" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On a historical note, the smaller EDs would not be dissimilar to the small number of Multi-Member Electorates that operate within the FPTP system. For example, in 1977, the Colombo-Central and Nuwara-Eliya Electorates (not to be confused with the Colombo and Nuwara-Eliya Districts) had three seats each. The three candidates getting the most number of votes won these seats.</p><h3 name="a270" id="a270" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Questions</h3><p name="3456" id="3456" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The topics discussed above lead to the following questions:</p><h4 name="1e1a" id="1e1a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Question 1: What would the electorate map look like if we returned to FPTP or adopted some mixed system?</h4><p name="7252" id="7252" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If the Parliamentary Select Committee proposes a return to FPTP or a mixed system, we must redefine electorates and redraw the electoral map. This is because the current electoral districts vary significantly in size.</p><p name="e382" id="e382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, at the 2012 census, Colombo-West had a population of ~54K, while Kaduwela had 252K or almost five times as large. It would be unrepresentative for both to have one seat each.
