Where a prominent and powerful politician Hon. Loku Banda confesses to a callous and cadaverous crime. And many people believe it to be true.</p><p name="a173" id="a173" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon enough, though, Hon. Loku Banda’s supporters claim that the video is a “Deep Fake”. And they propagate another video. The “original”. Where said Hon. Loku Banda confesses, not to a callous and cadaverous crime. But to kissing kiddies and handling hands.</p><p name="7156" id="7156" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is true? The “fake” or the “original”?</p><p name="e1b8" id="e1b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Loku Banda is popular. Half the populace support him. And this half believe the “original” to be true.</p><p name="cedf" id="cedf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You, dear reader, on the other hand, sceptical and discerning, are slow. To jump to conclusions. The “fake” could be true. Or the “original” could be true. Or neither could be true. There is no evidence. One way or the other.</p><p name="556c" id="556c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All your friends (the few people you trust) agree with you. And so you adopt agnosticism.</p><h3 name="ac93" id="ac93" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Relative and Absolute Truth</h3><p name="76e9" id="76e9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“1 + 1 = 2” is true. By definition. Because in modern mathematics “the definition of 2” is “that which is 1 + 1”.</p><p name="ae95" id="ae95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there are very few absolutely true things, like “1 + 1 = 2”.</p><p name="4520" id="4520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most things are true, on condition that other things are true. “Politician Hon. Loku Banda (LB) is honest” depends on “My friend believes that the Hon. LB is honest”. And “I believe that my friend is honest” and “My beliefs are reasonable”.</p><p name="3704" id="3704" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even truths like “It is raining outside” might depend on “I can see outside” and “I can see that it is raining”. And “I’m not hallucinating, and I can trust my senses”.</p><p name="8119" id="8119" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, most things we believe true are relative. Dependent on other truths. Which might not be true. As a result, many people may believe many different (and often contradictory) relative truths.</p><p name="66b5" id="66b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not always a problem. After all, most people might disagree on truths like “the true religion”, “the true political or economic system” or the “true way to make bread pudding”. Christianity is as true for a true Christian, as Capitalism is true for a true Capitalist.</p><h3 name="c1fc" id="c1fc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Truth by Vote</h3><p name="1f33" id="1f33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But sometimes we need a unified version of truth.</p><p name="0343" id="0343" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if prominent and powerful Loku Banda is summoned to court. For committing the callous and cadaverous crime. How would the “fake” and “original” videos feature as evidence?</p><p name="e86b" id="e86b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The judiciary would apply some process. To either side with one of the videos, or dismiss both. Either way, the process would “vote” on the videos.</p><p name="a726" id="a726" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Blockchains also work on this idea. A group of entities that don’t necessarily trust each other maintain a shared ledger of data, which they mutually trust to be true. The system “works”, as long as at least half the entities are “honest”.</p><p name="ab30" id="ab30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But can truth, like blockchain, be decided by vote?</p><p name="13c0" id="13c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Intuitively, there is something deeply unpleasant about this. To me. Perhaps to you, also.</p><h3 name="10d1" id="10d1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Nature of Truth</h3><p name="3fe3" id="3fe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But what is truth? Most dictionaries define “true” or “truth” in relation to reality. That which is “true” is that which is “real”. Consistent with reality.</p><p name="b7d3" id="b7d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But reality is subjective. Dependent on each observer. Each of us see our own version of reality. We can discuss our realities with each other. But we can’t truly experience the reality of another. And we can’t judge the “trueness” or the “realness” of these “other realities” .</p><p name="4e54" id="4e54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We might judge the reality of another. We might complain that “Common-man Punchi Singno is gullible”. Or that “Common-man Punchi Singno trusts Politician Loku Banda too much”. But in the end, these judgements are relative to our own.</p><p name="00c1" id="00c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, the nature of truth seems highly individual and decentralised. And “voting” on truth might not be unreasonable as it seems.</p><p name="c937" id="c937" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “unpleasantness” I felt might stem from my own prejudice. “My truth is more true than everyone else’s truth”. But everyone else also believes this. And voting breaks any ties.</p><figure name="b996" id="b996" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*s8zzxS8wjJKN2pmfvLZHlg.png" data-width="1328" data-height="870" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s8zzxS8wjJKN2pmfvLZHlg.png"></figure></div></div></section>
