On Forgiveness, Justice and Pain

<section name="1d17" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="d0b8" id="d0b8" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">Forgive them; for they know not what they do</h3><h4 name="f272" id="f272" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle">On Forgiveness, Justice and Pain</h4><p name="ea5d" id="ea5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To forgive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_Criticism" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_Criticism" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they say</a>, is divine. It is often difficult for us humans to forgive; certainly compared to other things we excel at, like erring.</p><p name="53a3" id="53a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve tried to forgive whenever I can, and a few times have even been successful. However, this article is about failures. More specifically, some reflections on two reasons why I’ve been unable to forgive.</p><h3 name="5d19" id="5d19" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Justice</h3><p name="48d2" id="48d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For you to forgive me, I should have wronged you. Without this <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">wronging</em>, forgiveness is meaningless. I might have punched you in the face, or spoken to you rudely, or knocked your bishop over, when your eyes were averted from the chess-board.</p><p name="9484" id="9484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In all such “wrongings”, great and small, there is a pattern. There are rules that define “right”; rules for decent behaviour, rules for speech, and rules for playing games like chess. And in all cases, doing a “wrong” involves breaking these rules. In other words, “wronging” is relative to some system of justice.</p><p name="d873" id="d873" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This “sense of wrong” is the first part of the justice system. The second part involves “putting the wrong right”; I might have to pay your medical bills (to compensate for the face-punching); or apologise in front of all our friends (for being rude to you), or forfeit that game of chess (for cheating).</p><p name="5b56" id="5b56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Collectives like countries, organisations, or even two friends playing chess, need rules such that they may operate smoothly. Without justice, systems tend to descend into chaos. And hence often, and not unreasonably, justice is hailed as a virtue.</p><p name="33d7" id="33d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, justice has problems. It is relative and arbitrary. It depends on who defines the rules. The people who define the rules (often plutocrats and politicians) tend to legislate as it suits them. For example, I could define some “laws” that make punching you, or being rude to you, or cheating at chess, “just” and “justifiable”.</p><p name="282d" id="282d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, it is best to be mindful of justice’s weaknesses, use it only when necessary, and not be too profoundly identified or “married” to it. It is a tool, like a knife, that, when used carefully and correctly, is useful. But when it is not essential, it is best not to cut others and oneself with it. “Judge not”, as they say.</p><p name="2b73" id="2b73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More relevant to this article however, justice has a deeper problem. It often undermines forgiveness.</p><p name="3965" id="3965" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often I’ve tried to forgive people but have not been able to, because justice reminds me loud and clear, “You are in the right! And you have been wronged! You should demand justice!” And at some level, forgiving seems to feel like undermining justice.</p><h3 name="a404" id="a404" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Pain</h3><p name="61c1" id="61c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Pain is the other thing that gets in the way of forgiveness.</p><p name="0249" id="0249" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have never been scourged and nailed through my hands and feet. Nor, I assume, have you, dear reader. And I hope neither of us ever will be.</p><p name="5985" id="5985" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But at times, when I have been “wronged”, I have felt significant physical and mental pain. When your mind or body is in pain, forgiveness becomes even more difficult.</p><p name="62ca" id="62ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you forgive someone who has caused (or is causing) you real pain?</p><p name="567a" id="567a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The path for me begins with “<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Luke-23-34/" data-href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Luke-23-34/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they know not</a>”, or the realisation that people wrong and cause pain through ignorance. Not ignorance of justice, but ignorance of how fellow beings are and feel.</p><p name="d50e" id="d50e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The opposite of this ignorance is compassion: the ability to internalise another’s suffering. If I genuinely had such an ability, I would not have punched you in the face.</p><p name="8ae5" id="8ae5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But even more profoundly, if you could understand and internalise that I too was “suffering”, not from a painful face, but from ignorance, you too would have found it easier to forgive me. If the punching were reversed, I too, you, I’m sure.</p><h3 name="1522" id="1522" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Confessions</h3><p name="b3d1" id="b3d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Reflecting on the limitations of justice and the distractions of pain have made forgiving a little easier. However, it is still a challenge, and I do not forgive as much as I should. Nor do I expect you do.</p><p name="7012" id="7012" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I hope we can forgive ourselves for that.</p><p name="bf3e" id="bf3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After all, to err, is human.</p><figure name="cfe3" id="cfe3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fuH6u51SVY5F_C80Q7I8NA.jpeg" data-width="495" data-height="500" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fuH6u51SVY5F_C80Q7I8NA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--figure-em">Forgive Thy Brother</em></strong> by Scott Erickson (Photo Source: <a href="https://charterforcompassion.org/report-from-the-charter-for-compassion-religion-spirituality-and-interfaith-call-april-22-2014" data-href="https://charterforcompassion.org/report-from-the-charter-for-compassion-religion-spirituality-and-interfaith-call-april-22-2014" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Charter For Compassion</a>)</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
