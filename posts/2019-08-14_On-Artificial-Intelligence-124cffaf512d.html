Early Computer Scientists were fascinated at how simple artificial neural networks, which had a general resemblance to the neurones and synaptic connections of the brain, could solve simple problems. Many hailed a new age, and a new type of computer which could end-up solving all problems humans could solve, and attain and surpass human intelligence.</p><p name="6d2b" id="6d2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This euphoria was short-lived and died down. Firstly, due to hardware constraints, early AI systems could not scale beyond toy problems. Secondly, there was more and more debate and controversy on how exactly human intelligence worked, and how humans solve problems. Humans had little consensus on what “Human Intelligence” meant, let alone the “Artificial” variety. Finally, there were systems which bore no resemblance to the brain what-so-ever but could still solve interesting and “intelligent” problems.</p><h4 name="4cd0" id="4cd0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Definition 2: Machines that solve problems that humans used to solve better than machines, better than humans</h4><p name="5795" id="5795" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Hence, the focus moved away from “how” machines solved problems to “what” problems machines solved. Computer Scientists have focussed on getting machines to solve intelligent problems while leaving the definition and study of intelligence to philosophers and psychologists.</p><p name="97b3" id="97b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, “intelligence” was still poorly defined. What made a problem an intelligent problem?</p><p name="fa45" id="fa45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Computer Scientists adopted the somewhat problematic definition of defining an “Intelligent Problem” as problems that “humans can solve better than machines”. Playing complex games like Chess, or recognizing hand-writing, or writing “creatively”, were all considered examples of “intelligent problems”, because at the time, humans could solve them better than machines.</p><p name="8966" id="8966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This definition was problematic because the moment a machine could solve an intelligent problem better than a human, the problem ceased to be an “intelligent problem” (by definition). Hence, as computers got better an better at playing Chess, eventually beating grand-masters, playing Chess was considered less AI and more mechanical machine task.</p><h4 name="743d" id="743d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Definition 3: Machines that solve problems, that humans can’t solve</h4><p name="8c55" id="8c55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The last decade has seen an explosion in data collection and hardware capable of processing this data. In parallel, new software algorithms capable of exploiting these data and hardware trends have developed (e.g. Deep Learning algorithms).</p><p name="cd25" id="cd25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Processing tera-bytes of data is beyond any human. Hence, the latest incarnation of AI attempts to solve problems that humans can’t solve. While we still use anthropomorphic words like “Intelligence”, AI is increasingly diverging from human intelligence.</p><p name="d7f5" id="d7f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, the future of AI has no bounds. Any problem is fair game. Many of these problems are currently solved by humans, and these humans are at risk of loosing their jobs.</p><h3 name="73c1" id="73c1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">On Competence</h3><p name="725b" id="725b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">While I’ve used the word “Intelligence” several times in this article, I don’t really know what that word actually means. Nor do other computer scientists, philosophers, or psychologists. There is a lot of interesting discussion and debate, but no consistent and widely recognized definition.</p><p name="a5f1" id="a5f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But for all practical purposes, when we say “Artificial Intelligence” we mean “Artificial Competence” or “a machines ability to solve problems”.</p><p name="45f3" id="45f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we might know what a specific machine is capable of, we have no sense of what machines can do “in general”. Or the “set of all problems that machines can solve”. The converse question is also interesting: “the set of all problems that machines cannot solve”, and its subset “the set of all problems that machines cannot solve, but humans can”.</p><h3 name="e868" id="e868" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">On Human Competence</h3><p name="c3ef" id="c3ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Throughout most of the last 200 years, our notion of “Human Competence” or “the set of all problems humans can solve” has changed little. Many human institutions like education root themselves on this two-centuries-old philosophy.</p><p name="cc40" id="cc40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, in the last couple of years, we have been rudely awakened by trends in AI (or should I say AC), globalization and rising inequality. Many types of “Human Competence” that we took for granted have been replaced by “Artificial Competence”. This trend is accelerating.</p><p name="675e" id="675e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any problem that both humans and machines can perform will be taken over by machines. Hence, going forward, I’m going to use the term “Human Competence” to refer to (not “the set of all problems that humans can solve”, but) <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“the set of all problems that machines cannot solve, but humans can”</strong>.</p><figure name="151a" id="151a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4VGmr43Gj_wnfCFDVSWcFQ.png" data-width="1140" data-height="581" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4VGmr43Gj_wnfCFDVSWcFQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">(Created with <a href="https://app.creately.com" data-href="https://app.creately.com" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://app.creately.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 name="848b" id="848b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">On the Future</h3><p name="5229" id="5229" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Many describe a future where most humans will be out of work, a minority that owns all capital will rule the world. It is unclear how we avoid this dystopia, without first, correctly understanding “Human Competence” and its characteristics.</p><p name="997f" id="997f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This understanding consists of studying and finding answers to the following questions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="075a" id="075a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">What are the properties of Human Competence?
