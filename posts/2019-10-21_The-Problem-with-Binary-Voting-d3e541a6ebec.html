The referendum was close with ~52% (17,410,742 voters) voting to leave, and ~48% (16,141,241 voters) voting to remain.</p><p name="a5d0" id="a5d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t want to argue about the pros and cons of leaving or remaining. Instead, I want to point out some problems in the referendum itself. And possibly suggest an alternative.</p><h3 name="0158" id="0158" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Timing</h3><p name="b370" id="b370" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This graph presents opinion poll results from 2015 to 2018, on how the British populace supported leave and remain. For most of late 2015 and early 2016, the British narrowly supported remain. Then just before the referendum leave took a narrow lead, which it maintained for the rest of 2016. Then, starting in early 2017 remain retook the lead.</p><figure name="78c1" id="78c1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_3xk4tIc81Jv1zSyYAASrA.png" data-width="1280" data-height="757" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_3xk4tIc81Jv1zSyYAASrA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/22/support-for-britains-exit-from-the-eu-is-waning" data-href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/22/support-for-britains-exit-from-the-eu-is-waning" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Economist</a></figcaption></figure><p name="65e1" id="65e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Hence, the time of the referendum vote played a huge role in the outcome. If the vote was held in April 2016 or June 2017, remain might have won. Again, I’m not saying remain should have won. I’m just pointing out the significance “timing” played in Brexit. And this feels uncomfortable and arbitrary. Why should time play a role?</p><h3 name="9051" id="9051" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Disappointment</h3><p name="7546" id="7546" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For the entire period depicted in the graph above, support for remain and leave did not fall below ~42% and ~40% respectively. Hence, when leave won the referendum, at least 42% of the country would have been disappointed by the result.</p><p name="457a" id="457a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, any hypothetical vote in April 2016 or June 2017 would have resulted in at least 40% of the country being disappointed.</p><h3 name="b08c" id="b08c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Binary Trivialisation</h3><p name="cbe2" id="cbe2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The biggest problem (not implied in the graph) was probably holding a referendum in the first place. I.e. trivializing and simplifying a very complicated question into a simple yes/no vote.</p><p name="61ef" id="61ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we’ve learned anything from the countless deals and the failed votes in parliament is that Brexit is complex and complicated. Then why was it decomposed into a simple yes/no vote?</p><h3 name="4cc5" id="4cc5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">An alternative?</h3><p name="1d54" id="1d54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I don’t really have an alternative. But perhaps, a sliver of an iota of a drop of an idea.</p><p name="0aaa" id="0aaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if the 52% to 48% result was interpreted differently? Instead of trivializing it as a simple yes/no, what if the full proportion was taken into account? And what if a committee of 52 leave-MPs and 48 remain-MPs were formed to define and negotiate a deal with the EU?</p><p name="8402" id="8402" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And to take into account the variance in peoples views, what if any decision within the 100 MP committee needed a majority of at least 20? I.e. at least 60 MPs must be in favour?</p><p name="87de" id="87de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">As I said, this is not a proper alternative. But there might be <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">something</em> in it.</p></div></div></section>
