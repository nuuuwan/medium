Confessions of a Work-from-home Chocoholic

Level paper-marking. Like the shorter vacations in April and December, I loved the first few days of “The Holidays”, where we could sleep till late, not worry about homework, and spend hours on things which we didn’t have time for during term time.</p><p name="4907" id="4907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike April and December, I gradually used to get bored, and after about four weeks, I would often mope about the house racking my brains on what to do. However, this feeling of meaningless boredom soon ended, as the vacation, itself drew to a close. As the impending doom of early mornings and homework became more and more visible on the horizon, the vacation regained its privileged status.</p><p name="a739" id="a739" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, despite the depression in the middle, the last week of an August vacation, was often the best time. Rather like the last teaspoons of chocolate mousse.</p><p name="cb1d" id="cb1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="38b9" id="38b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CoViD19 has turned vacations on its head. The idea of staying for a few days by the beach, or the mountains, or some other place away from home is fast becoming a distant dream. When I lived in London, a train ride or budget flight would land you in another country, one or two time zones away. Today, I console myself with documentaries and my notes on my travels.</p><p name="2e3a" id="2e3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For most of this year, I have worked from home with no physical contact with co-workers. All my meetings and other collaborations have been online. Hence, home is also work, and the line is increasingly blurred.</p><p name="3042" id="3042" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I’m one of the lucky ones. Many work-from-homers have had to take pay cuts or lay-off co-workers. Still, others have lost their jobs. Still others never had the luxury of an office job and relied on the ability to leave home to work. For these souls, home is not a place of safety or rest, but the opposite; a sort of economic prison. Those who still have homes, that is…</p><p name="626c" id="626c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="64f4" id="64f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I miss proper vacations, but I console myself that at some point they will be back; though in what form, only time will tell.</p><p name="b5ef" id="b5ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I also try not to rely too much on the future. Some small adjustments can make the present a bit more bearable. For example, consider weekends.</p><p name="0e72" id="0e72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I noticed that my weekends were getting blurred with weekdays. On weekdays I worked at home, and on weekends I was at home, and mostly worked. The sameness of the place created a sort of monotony of action. Hence, though I didn’t have to work on a Sunday, I did because that was what I mostly did at the place where I was.</p><p name="1f27" id="1f27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve gradually weaned myself away from this. I don’t work on weekends anymore, and instead, make time for more leisure and family activities. This “differentiation” makes weekends more like vacations, and the weekday more productive. And miraculously, despite the utter lack of proper vacations, I’m beginning to reap some of there benefits, like mental rest and refreshment.</p><p name="1703" id="1703" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been trying to lose a bit of weight, and have kept away from sweet desserts for a few weeks. But in the spirit of “making weekends more like vacations”, I loosened this rule a bit. I recall last night and the last few mouthfuls of a chocolatey dessert that I love.</p><p name="bd39" id="bd39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vacations wouldn’t be vacations without the lack of vacations. Pleasure necessarily depends on pain. Chocolate Mousse would not be Chocolate Mousse without no Chocolate Mousse.</em></p><figure name="411d" id="411d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LH-YCjFcRjQumacxzDbk8Q.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LH-YCjFcRjQumacxzDbk8Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: <a href="https://www.spicebangla.com/chocolate-mousse-recipe/" data-href="https://www.spicebangla.com/chocolate-mousse-recipe/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.spicebangla.com/chocolate-mousse-recipe/</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
