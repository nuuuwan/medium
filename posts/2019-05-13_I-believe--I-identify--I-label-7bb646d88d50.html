There are things we know might be either true or false. When we say we “believe” something, we choose to treat something that could be true or false (often false) as true — as something we “know”.</p><p name="1be0" id="1be0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world is complicated. And there are many things we do to simplify this complicated world. “Beliefs” are simplifications. Ancient humans didn’t know if the sun would rise tomorrow. Hence, without worrying, they chose to believe that each day a Sun-god drives his chariot over the skies.</p><h3 name="8dcf" id="8dcf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Identity</h3><p name="e4b8" id="e4b8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“Identity” is another such simplification. I “identify” as all sorts of things: Male, Sinhala, Sri Lankan, Buddhist, Computer Scientist, Musician etc etc etc. These identities, to some extent, describe me, and are, to some extent useful. For example, my “Male” identity tells me which lavatory to use in a public place. At the same time, these identities tend to over-simplify me — they don’t, even in aggregate, capture who I actually am.</p><p name="fb33" id="fb33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Believing in something doesn’t make it true. Believing in a Sun god doesn’t generate, or create a Sun god. In that sense, belief does not change the world. But it does change the believer. In fact, it is the first thing that is changed. When a believer believes, he or she acquires an identity — that of the group that believe.</p><p name="9cf3" id="9cf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, some identities stem from belief. For example, if you believe in the four noble truths, or the three characteristics, and act accordingly, you might call yourself a Buddhist.</p><p name="7a2d" id="7a2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But do all identities stem from identity? What about Sinhala or Male? Surely, these are facts?</p><p name="3afd" id="3afd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All humans are supposed to have evolved out of Africa, moving to Asia and Europe, and then Australia and the Americas. A few moved to the Island of Sri Lanka, and over time, established an ethnicity and culture we call Sinhala. I don’t know the exact date on which “Sinhala” came into being — there must have been some day where one could say “Today there are Sinhala people. But yesterday there weren’t”. I don’t know. What I do know is today, myself and another ~15 million humans identifying with this ethnicity and culture call themselves “Sinhala”.</p><p name="d93e" id="d93e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But surely, you might say, “Male” is a “fact” isn’t it? If one has an XY chromosome pair, one is male. But it’s not that simple. When most of us think “Male”, do we think of chromosomes? It’s more likely that concepts like “behavior”, “dress”, “likes”, “dislikes” come to mind. I know for a fact that I have an XY chromosome pair. But I don’t “know” that I should where trousers, instead of skirts — Or prefer blue to pink*, or women to men. These are all preferences I have “identified” with.</p><p name="8e72" id="8e72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[* Pink for girls, and Blue for boys is a relatively new phenomena. In many older contexts, these colors are reversed. For example, in the Catholic church, Pink is often associated with males — cardinals and Christ, while blue is associated with females — the Virgin Mary, and nuns].</em></p><p name="645f" id="645f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Computer Scientist and Musician are even weaker identities. Does a degree or a diploma in some subject confer anything of meaning on one? Neither Alan Turing nor Mozart had degrees is Computer Science or Music.</p><h3 name="a5b9" id="a5b9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Labels</h3><p name="77c1" id="77c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In the end, beliefs and identities are labels; labels that simplify the world. They are illusions that make us assume that the world is simpler that it is. Some of these assumptions can be very dangerous. For example, we might assume that some people are evil, and others are good. That some deserve our compassion and kindness, but others don’t. That some people are, innately better, or superior, or more worthy of our respect.</p><p name="4eb6" id="4eb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There can be no true understanding, as long as we rely on beliefs, identities, and labels.</p><h3 name="1139" id="1139" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Pledge</h3><p name="19e4" id="19e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This article is actually a pledge; A “pledge of letting go” which I want to take in front of you all, my friends.</p><blockquote name="8661" id="8661" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I pledge to let go of all beliefs, of all identities, and all labels.”</blockquote><p name="d97d" id="d97d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">Of course, such a pledge is easier taken and observed. I’m likely to break it often. Hence, it will need constant retaking and renewal. But at least, I hope, it will be a start.</p></div></div></section>
