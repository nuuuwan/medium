As time “increases” so does information. In other words, there is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more information</em> in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">present</em>, than there was in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">past</em>.</p><p name="f5b3" id="f5b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, suppose we toss a coin. After the coin lands heads or tails, there is one additional bit of information (namely whether the coin landed heads or tails) in the universe. Before the coin toss, this information didn’t exist.</p><p name="d3fd" id="d3fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be clear, a coin toss results in a lot more information than a single bit. For example, if the coin landed on the ground, there is its precise location. There is the collective memory of the people who saw the coin toss. There might be some additional record of the coin toss; someone might have written down the outcome, or recorded it on video. In practice, the coin toss probably resulted in exa-bytes of data.</p><p name="518a" id="518a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But let’s ignore these details for now. My point is: information increases with time, or alternatively, time increases with information.</p><h3 name="222b" id="222b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Stopping Time</h3><p name="d27f" id="d27f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Now suppose that the coin was indeed tossed, but there was no record of it. Suppose, no one remembered the outcome of the toss, nor was it recorded on video, and nor did anyone write down the outcome.</p><p name="7b60" id="7b60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, if there is no record of the outcome of the coin toss, can we say that information has been added to the universe?</p><p name="7bd0" id="7bd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if information was not added to the universe, did time pass? Given that the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">present</em> has the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">same</em> information as the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">past</em>?</p><h3 name="de0d" id="de0d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Reversing Time</h3><p name="d384" id="d384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Now suppose that the coin was tossed, and its outcome (say, heads) was recorded on multiple media: paper, video, and the collective memories of several bystanders.</p><p name="cb9d" id="cb9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, suppose that soon after that the following happened: the paper with the outcome was burned; the video was dismiised as a fake, probably doctored by the Russians, Hillary Clinton, or Wile E. Coyote; and all the bystanders got amnesia, probably as a result of attending a 5 Seconds of Summer concert.</p><p name="e733" id="e733" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, the past (soon after the coin toss) clearly contained that bit of information about the outcome of the coin-toss. But the present (post paper burning, Russian fakes, and 5 Seconds of Summer), does not contain the said bit. Hence, the present has <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">less information</em> than the past. Hence, did we travel back in time?</p><h3 name="8ed6" id="8ed6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Perspective</h3><p name="4359" id="4359" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We say that after tossing the coin there was more information in the universe. But is this actually true?</p><p name="e4c0" id="e4c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know how much information exists in all that is the universe: probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exa-" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exa-" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exa-exa-exa-bytes</a>, give or take. Was it that the coin-toss increased this information, or that we decided to arbitrarily label some set of information as new information?</p><p name="c06f" id="c06f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Was it that we decided that some set of information represents “no outcome”, and a different set (with the same amount of information) represents “some outcome”?</p><p name="4dbc" id="4dbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And would this apply to all information? Everything that we know? Mere labels of things we choose to know and choose not to know?</p><figure name="e0a5" id="e0a5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*YbRT1Hh1CLbgrHEBebRo-g.jpeg" data-width="946" data-height="1198" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YbRT1Hh1CLbgrHEBebRo-g.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
