Variations of these questions often refer to “experts”: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“How can I be an AI expert?”</strong> or <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“How can we (our company) become a leader in AI expertise?”</strong></p><p name="55ea" id="55ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This article attempts to answer these questions, or at least satisfy the motivations behind them. Personally, I don’t consider myself an “AI expert” (in all but the most self-deluding senses of the phrase). However, I have studied AI at a graduate level, and have worked on some meaningful AI problems. I have also met, worked and learnt from several people who can claim to be AI experts of world renown. These experiences have influenced this article.</p><h3 name="1ecc" id="1ecc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The AI Expert</h3><p name="12e7" id="12e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What does an AI Expert look like?</p><h4 name="e164" id="e164" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">An AI Expert is a Scientist and an Artist</h4><p name="33d4" id="33d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Most AI theory can be understood with undergraduate level Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics. With some practice, most cutting edge AI research publications can be read and understood with this knowledge. If you don’t believe me, try some AI courses online (e.g. <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai" data-href="https://www.deeplearning.ai" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.deeplearning.ai</a>) and read some papers yourself (e.g. <a href="https://papers.nips.cc" data-href="https://papers.nips.cc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://papers.nips.cc</a>).</p><p name="5a02" id="5a02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All AI experts have had a solid background in these fundamentals (often) from a young age, and acquired a seamless sense of how to apply these in a scientific way. This is what I mean by “scientist”.</p><p name="f2ce" id="f2ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, this knowledge alone is not sufficient to succeed at AI. Practical AI involves significant intuition and (sometimes) guesswork. The most skilled AI experts “seem to know” what to do without being able to explain how or why, the same way an artist paints a canvas or a poet writes a poem. This is what I mean by “artist”. Just as in the hands of the best poets “the poem writes the poem”, in the hands of the best AI experts “the model designs the model” or “the AI writes the AI”.</p><h4 name="2c07" id="2c07" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">An AI Expert has access to resources</h4><p name="dff7" id="dff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Almost all world-renown AI Experts are affiliated to top companies (e.g. Google, Facebook, Microsoft) or top universities (e.g. MIT, Stanford, Tsinghua) with access to huge monetary resources. This is because cutting edge AI requires training huge models, on huge amounts of data, on huge hardware infrastructures.</p><p name="ace6" id="ace6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition to hardware resources, AI problems also involve significant human participation. For example, a company like Google employs 1000s of engineers and data scientist to work on their AI systems. This too involves huge monetary investments, and the AI experts that head these projects control how these resources are used.</p><h4 name="21c8" id="21c8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">An AI Expert has access to meaningful data</h4><p name="b6d7" id="b6d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Most importantly, AI needs data. By “meaningful” data I mean data that can be used to solve meaningful problems. If you don’t have good problems to solve, there is no reason to bother trying, even if you have data. Conversely, you might have interesting problems, but without data, you can’t use AI.</p><h3 name="fa6c" id="fa6c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Backdoor Approach</h3><p name="f034" id="f034" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you want to be an AI expert, you might try and acquire these characteristics: Study AI at a top university, and then join an institution with resources and interesting problems.</p><p name="3a86" id="3a86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, the odds of becoming an internationally (or even nationally) renown AI expert are slim. And anyway, this article is not about “how to succeed at being an AI expert”. Instead, this article is about <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“how to succeed at AI”.</strong></p><p name="1c74" id="1c74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “backdoor” approach involves following the “what an AI expert looks like” ideas in reverse.</p><h4 name="1ce8" id="1ce8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Step 1: Find a problem you care about</h4><p name="fec9" id="fec9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Always start with a problem. What problems do you care about? Solving what problems would result in profit or gain to you? If you can’t find a problem you care about, find a problem which other people (say your boss, or other people in your town, region, or country, or company) care about.</p><p name="904c" id="904c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, see if this problem can be solved using data. You don’t have to solve the problem 100%. See if you can solve it 10%. Often, a 10% solution, might yield 90% of the gains. Also, you don’t need to apply the most complex AI technique to solve the problem. See if a simple solution can solve the problem. What’s the point in using Deep Learning, if a simple rule engine can give you a good enough solution?</p><h4 name="1b99" id="1b99" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Step 2: Create your own resources</h4><p name="e17e" id="e17e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Even partially solving the problem (say a 10% solution), gives you a couple of new advantages: You can use the partial solution to convince other people that you might be able to attempt a complete solution, and give you the resources you need. You can also use the profits from the partial solution to invest in resources (say people or hardware) that can be used for a better solution.</p><h4 name="7949" id="7949" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Step 3 (Optional): Become a scientist and/or an artist</h4><p name="7e0c" id="7e0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The best way to become a writer, is to write as much as you can. Similarly, the best way to become an “AI Artist” is to work on as many interesting AI problems. Hence, finding good AI problems is the best start to this journey.</p><p name="7c52" id="7c52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same applies to being a “AI Scientist”. You can always go to university and get a Masters or a PhD in AI, or more easily complete a course in AI (in a few weeks or less) online. But if you have interesting problems to work on, you have a lot more motivation to learn new techniques. You’re also less likely to forget what you learn.</p><h3 name="71f7" id="71f7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding thought</h3><p name="3203" id="3203" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you should take away one thing from this article, it is that “You should not see AI as a general qualification or privilege. You should see it as a specific tool or servant to solve your problems”. The most important thing is to learn to get that tool or servant to work for you. If you can do that, you can instantly start reaping meaningful benefits.</p><p name="b509" id="b509" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If not, “AI” will be to you, as it is for most people, a meaningless buzzword.</p></div></div></section>
