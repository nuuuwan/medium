At the same time, I was not completely happy with this agreement. For several reasons. Here’s why.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="58d8" id="58d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Doesn’t “Wrong means doing things like slapping people” depend on context? After all, “Killing people is wrong” depends on the context. For example, many would agree that self-defence is not wrong. Nor killing an enemy in battle.</li><li name="b8ce" id="b8ce" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do we mean “Was the monk wrong?” or “Was the monk doing a wrong thing?” Was the monk a criminal? Or was the monk committing a crime? Was the doer evil? Or was the deed evil?</li></ul><p name="fbd8" id="fbd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Why do I even care?</p><p name="5158" id="5158" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why can’t I (like most people in my “liberal” Twittersphere) just judge the monk as the embodiment of everything evil and be done with it?</p><h3 name="dcf4" id="dcf4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Here’s why.</h3><p name="2a4d" id="2a4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Hurting another, in any context, is distasteful. This is quite simple. But is it unreasonable? This is not quite simple.</p><p name="1567" id="1567" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Religious “marketing” has always been a touchy subject. Not just in Sri Lanka, but globally. Many wars have been fought. And much blood spilt. In Sri Lanka in particular, conversions by the Portuguese was particularly brutal and savage. More recently, there have been reports of poor Buddhist being “targeted” for religious conversion with economic carrots.</p><p name="6147" id="6147" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know the extent and nature of the “real situation”. A lot of the “data” is anecdotal and hearsay. Hence, I don’t know if there is a “problem” and its extent. But what I do know is that some people feel there is a problem. And some people try to “solve” the problem. For example, by attacking churches, verbal abuse and slapping people.</p><p name="f37e" id="f37e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, am I saying that Ven A. S. is reasonable? Not quite. But I am saying that he might have reasons. Whether or not I agree with these reasons is a different matter.</p><h3 name="b82f" id="b82f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">On Judging</h3><p name="8b09" id="8b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">While many might see the monk as wrong, this is why some might see him as “not wrong”. Many who find the action distasteful, might, regardless, find it justifiable at some level.</p><p name="a908" id="a908" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This underlies a deep philosophical point about human nature. And judging humans. It’s easy to judge deeds. Relatively. It is much harder to judge people. So much so, that some philosophies prohibit judging explicitly (“Judge not, that ye be not judged” — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_7:1" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_7:1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mathew 7:1</a>). Others implicitly (“Let his thoughts of boundless lovingkindness pervade the whole world” — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Karaniya Metta Sutta</a>).</p><p name="5f65" id="5f65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Am I trying to be a saint? Or “judge” those who aren’t? No. I have far more practical and “worldly” motives.</p><p name="af94" id="af94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The violent monk is definitely a problem. He must be dealt with. Ideally, by the police. Though given the preferential status Buddhist clergy enjoy in Sri Lanka, I doubt this will happen. At various times in history, the state has regulated and reformed the Buddhist clergy. We badly need such a reformation right now.</p><p name="7495" id="7495" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there is a bigger problem. We have a terrible habit of over-simplifying religious tensions. For example, one could argue “Religious freedom is a right. Religious marketers can do whatever they want. Period”. But this argument assumes that everyone agrees with this “freedom” or “right”. Without agreement, law is suppression. And many feel they are being suppressed in various ways. Whether they actually are, is not the point. Nor is whether others are suppressed even more. The point is that they believe they are.</p><h3 name="0900" id="0900" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">So what to do?</h3><p name="4e48" id="4e48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For me, the solution is simple. And complex. We must stop pretending that complex questions have simple answers. They might get you more twitter followers wallowing in an outrage culture. But a simple solution is almost always likely to be wrong. And, in the long term, you only end-up fanning hate, division, and intolerance.</p><p name="da31" id="da31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, we must see complex questions for what they are. They need clear thought and complicated solutions.</p><p name="2238" id="2238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Religious tension in Sri Lanka cannot be minimised to a few YouTube videos. But sadly, they are. We can’t afford that.</p><figure name="3113" id="3113" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*TSQcvrO3XAdoRy6Y0SAYXg.jpeg" data-width="1500" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TSQcvrO3XAdoRy6Y0SAYXg.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
