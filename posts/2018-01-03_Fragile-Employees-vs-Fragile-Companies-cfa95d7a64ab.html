The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate.”</blockquote><p name="be3c" id="be3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In the book, Taleb introduces antifragility as follows:</p><blockquote name="495c" id="495c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">randomness</em>, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">uncertainty</em></strong>. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better”</blockquote><p name="c36d" id="c36d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The relationship between the fragility and antifragility of various layers of a system, is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">common theme</strong> in the book. The key premise is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">fragility at one layer, promotes Antifragility one level higher, and vice versa</strong>. For example, Taleb talks about how fragile start-ups makes for an antifragile start-up ecosystem in Silicon Valley, while conversely, how antifragile too-big-to-fail banks, led to a fragile banking system during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2008 financial crisis</a>.</p><h4 name="a277" id="a277" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Antifragile Companies</h4><p name="f5a2" id="f5a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The “Amazon Experiment” (For the rest of this note, I’ll use the term “Amazon Experiment” to refer to the picture painted by the New York Times, and not necessarily reality) could be caricatured as <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“maximizing employee-layer fragility, to maximize company-layer antifragility”</strong>. One could argue that if achieving the companies mission is the top-priority, then doing everything possible to maximize company-layer antifragility, which might necessarily involve maximizing employee-layer fragility. In this light, the stresses, pressures and “Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.”-type culture seems reasonable, even optimal. Through one lens, this almost sounds like to argument the NYT is trying to make.</p><figure name="d4f0" id="d4f0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*d2xTS8p4gFlEaRS_Vq0dRA.png" data-width="284" data-height="163" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d2xTS8p4gFlEaRS_Vq0dRA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The “Amazon Experiment” as described by the New York Times</figcaption></figure><p name="41bf" id="41bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">However, I find this argument weak, for one simple reason: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">There are other ways of achieving company-layer antifragility</strong>. While overly stressing employees might work, why adopt a draconian strategy, when softer strategies might exist?</p><p name="d398" id="d398" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two of my favorite company-layer antifragility<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>strategies are Teams and (what I’d like to call) “Kicking fragility downstairs”.</p><h4 name="39d9" id="39d9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Teams</h4><p name="b7f0" id="b7f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Teams seek to balance competition with cooperation. Teams of employees working together to achieve common goals are more antifragile than individual employees who might be forced to compete unnecessarily with other employees. To frame this in “Antifragility-by-layers”-speak, we shelter all employees in a new layer known as a “Team” which is less fragile.</p><figure name="66ef" id="66ef" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sTcg0LNq_WvT_vRnXVHAiQ.png" data-width="274" data-height="145" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sTcg0LNq_WvT_vRnXVHAiQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Teams</figcaption></figure><p name="859f" id="859f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Now, in some cases, teams can be too antifragile, leading to the company as a whole becoming fragile. Often teams and broader sub-organizations become too powerful, political, and start behaving in ways that are counter to the company’s overall interests. Sometimes the company consists of many such teams which are locked in machinations and mutual distrust.</p><figure name="ea20" id="ea20" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lVa7hmQjrtKMO73TKAmd9Q.png" data-width="283" data-height="153" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lVa7hmQjrtKMO73TKAmd9Q.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Big Teams playing politics</figcaption></figure><p name="0bf0" id="0bf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Hence, some constraints are needed to ensure the right balance is reached. For example,</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ea3f" id="ea3f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Common Goals. Teams should have goals and missions which are closely aligned with the company’s overall goals and mission. This is a top-down way of constraining what a team does to things that are acceptable to the company as a whole.</li><li name="576f" id="576f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Communication. While things like “mission” and long term “vision” are common across companies, and are communicated top-down, it’s more efficient that shorter term strategies and tactics are framed at the grassroots level. However, these tactics must also be aligned across teams, and inter-team communication is vital for this.</li><li name="2489" id="2489" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Small Teams. One obvious way to prevent antifragile teams that lead to fragile companies is to make sure that no team is too big. However, with many questions of “small is good”, the challenge to make teams as small as possible, but not too small.</li></ul><h4 name="2c06" id="2c06" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Kicking fragility downstairs</h4><p name="19c1" id="19c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">An alternate approach is to move fragility down a level from employees to something else. But to what? The sometimes chastised adage <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Move fast and break things”</strong> offers some clues.</p><p name="73a4" id="73a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In its most generous interpretation, “Move fast” simply means that employees can operate in a efficient manner, while minimizing time and resource wastage. A corollary of “Move fast” is “Fail fast” — or an environment where employees experiment, try things, understand what works and what does not, and move on to the next thing quickly. “Break things” implicitly implies an environment where an employee can break things without actually breaking things — or in other words, there are safeguards against the consequences of moving fast — experiment at low cost.</p><figure name="7bba" id="7bba" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*q-U8iJLMtuO-ZUhKPKFeow.png" data-width="270" data-height="215" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*q-U8iJLMtuO-ZUhKPKFeow.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Move Fast</figcaption></figure><p name="2b26" id="2b26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In other words, a “Move fast and break things” culture and environment, enables employees to be antifragile, by moving fragility down to the level of processes and experiments. In such a world, an employee can succeed by failing 99 times, and succeeding once. As opposed to a “Move slow, and don’t break things” world, where they are fired for failing once.</p><h4 name="5fd2" id="5fd2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Concluding food for thought</h4><p name="d4e3" id="d4e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Hence, there are some reasonable ways to mitigate Company-Employee Fragility tensions, without too much pain. Let me end with describing a tension one level higher.</p><p name="d4c7" id="d4c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hhi.asp" data-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hhi.asp" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Herfindahl-Hershman Index (HHI) </a>measures the level of inter-company competition in an industry. It’s computed as follows: First, for every company in the industry, we compute its market share as a percentage; Second, the squares of these percentages are summed-up to give the index.The higher the HHI, the less competitive the industry. For example, an industry where one company has an absolute monopoly (i.e. a 100% market share), has an HHI of 10,000. An industry where two companies dominate equally (i.e. with 50% market shares each), has an HHI of 5000. A highly competitive market with 100 companies each with an equal market share of 1%, has an HHI of 100.</p><p name="e338" id="e338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many tech giants dominate their industries. For example, Google boasts <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/" data-href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly 80% of the Desktop Search</a>, leading to that industry having an HHI in excess 6,000. Applying some of the principles discussed above, we might conclude that overly antifragile companies will lead to fragile industries. This is probably a much bigger fragility problem.</p><figure name="8336" id="8336" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*G6_kPn38esdMDpsbH2ZXMA.png" data-width="301" data-height="169" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G6_kPn38esdMDpsbH2ZXMA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Monopolistic Companies</figcaption></figure><p name="9b58" id="9b58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bon Appétit!</em></p></div></div></section>
