Now, what does that tell you?</p><p name="a846" id="a846" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few things, at least: I had Rs. 2,000 to spare. I needed the shirt. The shirt was more <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">valuable</em> to me than the Rs. 2,000, and anything else that I needed, and was available for Rs. 2000 or less.</p><p name="64a7" id="64a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It also tells you: The shirt-seller had the shirt in stock. They needed Rs. 2,000. The Rs. 2,000 was more <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">valuable</em> to them than the shirt.</p><p name="9ade" id="9ade" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But now for something completely stupid.</p><h3 name="0539" id="0539" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Parenthesis: Homo Economicus</h3><p name="e92b" id="e92b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Economics “is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services” [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>]. Almost all of Classical Economics is stupid because it studies, not Homo Sapiens (as all social sciences must), but Homo Economicus.</p><p name="77d2" id="77d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Homo Economicus is a mythical being which is rational, innately self-interested, and makes optimal decisions, given the information it has. Homo Sapiens (like you and I), on the other hand, is irrational, not always self-interested, and often makes sub-optimal decisions.</p><p name="0ab0" id="0ab0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back to the real world.</p><h3 name="4dd5" id="4dd5" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”</h3><p name="d1be" id="d1be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The act of buying involves two acts: an act of buying <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">and</em> an act of selling.</p><p name="4dab" id="4dab" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Obviously!”</em>, you might say. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“You are buying a shirt, and the shirt-seller is selling it”.</em></p><p name="9ad4" id="9ad4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes and No. I am, indeed, buying the shirt. But I am also <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">selling</em> Rs. 2,000. The difference of this exchange is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">profit</em>. A rational being would not exchange anything without a positive profit. In our example, I exchanged Rs. 2,000 for a shirt because the shirt was more valuable to me, relative to the money. Conversely, the Rs. 2,000 was more valuable, relative to the shirt, to the shirt seller.</p><p name="5564" id="5564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, profit depends on value, and what “more valuable” means.</p><p name="cb2e" id="cb2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what does “more valuable” mean?</p><h3 name="3f52" id="3f52" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Everything connects to everything else”</h3><p name="345d" id="345d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In theory, one could take a microscopic view, and assign absolute value to everything — where everything has an <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">absolute</em> value, independent of everything else.</p><p name="824e" id="824e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, in practice, no one knowns how valuable anything is. The reason I bought the shirt was because it was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relatively</em> more valuable (to me) than the Rs. 2,000. And if I considered a pair of trousers, or a few days worth of groceries, or a book more valuable, I would not have bought the shirt. Hence, the value of the shirt was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relative</em>; not just to the Rs. 2,000, but countless other things that I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">might have needed</em>.</p><p name="3701" id="3701" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The concept of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">need</em> is also complex. Like value, it involves multiple factors and entities. It might also involve <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">price</em>. For example, the price of something might influence our <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">need</em> for it. Paradoxically, often the more expensive a good is, the more we feel we need them (either from wanting to spend on luxury, to believing a more expensive good is a better good).</p><p name="0ffb" id="0ffb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, when you consider the broader picture (the shirt-seller, other people that sell things to me, and the vast supply chains surrounding them), the value of my shirt is connected to the value of an almost infinity of things.</p><p name="0891" id="0891" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The value of anything in the the mind of anyone, is connected to the value of everything in the minds of everyone.</p><figure name="3e2f" id="3e2f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VhSYXfHaNgMxUAUm5r2LVg.gif" data-width="364" data-height="20" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VhSYXfHaNgMxUAUm5r2LVg.gif"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Value V, of a thing T, in the mind of a person P.</figcaption></figure><h3 name="4e3b" id="4e3b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">A stupid idea — Revisited</h3><p name="fcf0" id="fcf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Given the nature of value and its connectedness to everything, it is impossible to act like Homo Economicus, and make optimal buying and selling decisions, because we don’t really know what the value of anything is.</p><p name="be73" id="be73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The guardians of Homo Economicus (i.e. Classical Economists) usually give two rebuttals to this argument:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="67c0" id="67c0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">While, in theory, the value of a thing is connected to the value of everything, in practice a small set of these everything, have a disproportionately big influence on value. While, in theory, this is true, in practice, Economists are, at best, vague, and at worst, horribly wrong, on how big the small set of things is. Almost every economic disaster has been a result of Economists “mis-underestimating” the bigness of the small set.</li><li name="29ab" id="29ab" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The other argument is that, there are, indeed, things with “absolute” value: like money or gold. An Economist would tell you, “Rs. 1 has a value of exactly Rs. 1”. Again, true, in theory, but false in practice. We know that inflation, and devaluation affect the value of all money. But even if we discount effects like inflation, we know from experience that Rs. 1,000 that we worked hard for, or was a gift from a close relative, has a lot more value to us than Rs. 1,000 we won in a lottery, or randomly picked-up on a street. Hence, even money has no <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">absolute</em> value.</li></ol><h3 name="ad86" id="ad86" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuÿle</h3><p name="0b04" id="0b04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are two types of person to whom this article is irrelevant.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="361c" id="361c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The first type is the Rich Person. And by rich person, I don’t mean Dhammika Perera or Victor Hartmann’s Samuel Goldenberg, or even Bill Gates. I mean someone so rich that they could buy out Bill Gates, the entire United States of America (People, Resources, Finances and all), and the entire Peoples’ Republic of China, with their spare change. For this person, nothing has price. There is no difference between a $1 bill and a $100 bill.</li><li name="31de" id="31de" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The second type is the hermit, who has renounced worldly things and comforts. Just as for the Rich Person nothing has price, for the hermit, nothing has value.</li></ol><p name="96f8" id="96f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">We all (including you, me, Perera and Gates) sit on a vast spectrum between the Rich Person and the hermit. And there is some consolation that if we are pressured in one direction, we can always go in the other. If we are short of money, then we can be a little more like a hermit. And if our lives are too hermit-like, we can splurge a little like a Rich Person.</p><figure name="a866" id="a866" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LO5FD1P89vTfbres87z0JA.jpeg" data-width="984" data-height="615" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LO5FD1P89vTfbres87z0JA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><em class="markup--em markup--figure-em">Pictures at an Exhibition</em>, Victor Alexandrovitch Hartmann</figcaption></figure><h3 name="1f8c" id="1f8c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Bonus Consolation</h3><p name="37c7" id="37c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But there is an assumption behind the value of different things. That different things have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">different</em> values. But what happens when this assumption is broken?
