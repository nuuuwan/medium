Betting on the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Elections

But my personal favourite is that they face no downside if they make bogus predictions. They say whatever nonsense comes to mind and leave the poor client to face the music. As far as the charlatan is concerned it is heads you lose, tails he wins.</p><figure name="f41e" id="f41e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oUVAPJ8HLmdGE6Ux134HAA.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="700" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oUVAPJ8HLmdGE6Ux134HAA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Astrologers have absolutely no #SkinInTheGame.</figcaption></figure><p name="c07f" id="c07f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As Nasim Taleb would have put it, astrologers have absolutely no #SkinInTheGame.</p><p name="f9ed" id="f9ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many astrologers have made predictions about the 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Elections. And so have many Data Scientists: professional and amateur (like yours truly).</p><p name="c9b9" id="c9b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, too many Data Scientists have been making predictions based on suspect methodologies. But since they too, like astrologers, have no #SkinInTheGame, they have no incentive to do otherwise.</p><p name="4cbc" id="4cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this article, I describe a simple strategy to add #SkinInTheGame to predictions: All predictions must be accompanied by betting odds. You can’t predict, if you also don’t let everyone else (or at least your friends) bet on your odds.</p><h3 name="4ef3" id="4ef3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How to define odds</h3><p name="9595" id="9595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Recently, an astrologer turned data scientists (or data scientist turned astrologer — it is hard to tell the difference sometimes), sent me a lengthy analysis which concluded that Mr Rajapaksa would get 55% of the national vote, and Mr Premadasa 45%.</p><p name="cac5" id="cac5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “analysis” was utter garbage, but I thought I’d use it as an illustrative example.</p><p name="df36" id="df36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given the 55% probability for Purple, the odds in favour of Blue is 55/45, or 11/9. The odds are the “probability of winning” divided by the “probability of loosing”. If Blue wins, and you bet Rs. 55, you win an additional Rs. 45.</p><p name="00c1" id="00c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similarly, your odds for Green would be 45/55, or 9/11. If Green wins and you bet Rs.45, you win an additional Rs.55.</p><p name="d239" id="d239" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Punters would note that I make two assumptions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="fd73" id="fd73" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">That the market is rational and efficient. I.e. that the market’s notion of probability would be identical to the bookmakers.</li><li name="a540" id="a540" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The bookmaker is “not-for-profit”, and keeps no margin on bets. In the real world, bookmakers would have anything from a 5% to 50% margin on bets.</li></ol><p name="1f86" id="1f86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This is correct.</p><h3 name="dcd4" id="dcd4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">So Nuwan, what odds are <em class="markup--em markup--h3-em">you</em> giving?</h3><p name="a610" id="a610" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The closest I came to giving probabilities for candidates was in <a href="https://medium.com/on-politics/a-machines-opinion-cfc942f6ccca" data-href="https://medium.com/on-politics/a-machines-opinion-cfc942f6ccca" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">A Machine’s Opinion</a>.</p><figure name="b480" id="b480" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*y1DesBsC1XKpaZvUL_z4mw.png" data-width="1832" data-height="434" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y1DesBsC1XKpaZvUL_z4mw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">What my laptop thought (<a href="https://medium.com/on-politics/a-machines-opinion-cfc942f6ccca" data-href="https://medium.com/on-politics/a-machines-opinion-cfc942f6ccca" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" target="_blank">A Machine’s Opinion</a>.)</figcaption></figure><p name="9650" id="9650" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Green would probably get between 38.4% and 51.2% of the vote, and the Blues between 46.4% and 59.1%.</p><p name="2eec" id="2eec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a bit different from the previous example because this is not single probabilities, but “Error Bounds” of probabilities. How might we translate these numbers into betting odds?</p><p name="82d6" id="82d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In each scenario, we would have to assume the worst case from the bookmaker’s point-of-view. And as a result, define odds based on the best case probability for each candidate.</p><p name="c115" id="c115" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, we would assume that Green had a 51.2% chance of winning, and Blue had a 59.1% chance of winning. Rounding up for good measure, the odds would be something like 14/13 for Green and 3/2 for Blue.</p><h3 name="4bef" id="4bef" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">But isn’t this Illegal?</h3><p name="5a15" id="5a15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To be clear, I won’t be making any “books” for the next election. And to be even clearer, 59.1% and 51.2% were not my opinions. Readers of <a href="https://medium.com/on-politics/a-machines-opinion-cfc942f6ccca" data-href="https://medium.com/on-politics/a-machines-opinion-cfc942f6ccca" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">A Machine’s Opinion </a>would know that it was my laptop’s opinion. So if you have any questions on betting,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> talk to the machine, ‘cos the Human ‘ain’t listening.</strong></p><p name="cf29" id="cf29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, if you are a proper Data Scientist and you’ve offered odds, you have a “get out of jail free card”: Error Bounds. Given the complexity and uncertainty around the election, any legitimate prediction should have huge Error Bounds. I’d say even broader than the 38.4% to 51.2% that I (ahem, I mean my laptop) came up with.</p><figure name="3992" id="3992" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*IzmAOcujIfdaQUwSs5-76A.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="856" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IzmAOcujIfdaQUwSs5-76A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">“get out of jail free card”</figcaption></figure><p name="5ab3" id="5ab3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The good thing about error bars is that it will result in you (the bookmaker) making such huge profits that the bet will look nothing like a bet, and more like a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">donation</em>. And as far as I know, there is no law against charitable donations to deserving Data Scientists.</p><p name="937a" id="937a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bad thing is, with such odds, no one in their right mind will bet.</p><p name="b6ac" id="b6ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The astrologers and bad Data Scientist, who don’t understand error bounds, have no “get out of jail free card”. Not only are they likely to lose money on bets, but the authorities are also likely to charge them with criminal behaviour. And about time.</p><p name="fc2e" id="fc2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Happy Punting!</p></div></div></section>
