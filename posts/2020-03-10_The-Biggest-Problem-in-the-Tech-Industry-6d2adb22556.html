Privacy? A few large corporations controlling the show?</p><p name="84a9" id="84a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of these are good answers. You might favour one over another depending on your circumstances.</p><p name="a6d7" id="a6d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My “circumstances” have involved a lot of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">recruiting</strong>. I’ve spent much of the last two years hiring Software Engineers (SWEs). It has been tough. I don’t mean any-ol’ coder. They are a dime a dozen. I mean recruiting “A-Grade” SWEs:</p><blockquote name="b4e1" id="b4e1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“[A-Grade] candidates have, besides professional skills and social, behavioural and cultural skills, the right mindset and motivation to work well in an organisation” — <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/on-software-engineers-f16bdafef43d" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/on-software-engineers-f16bdafef43d" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" target="_blank">On Software Engineers</a></blockquote><p name="dfa4" id="dfa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Hence, relative to my circumstances, the biggest problem is recruiting “A-Grade” SWEs. The supply is low. The demand (particularly from “A-Grade” software companies) is high.</p><p name="f0a4" id="f0a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Am I talking about Sri Lanka? Or Silicon Valley? Well, both. The problem is global. For the sake of focus and clarify, I’m going to focus on Sri Lanka. But the ideas and implications extend worldwide.</p><p name="1923" id="1923" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How do we fix the shortage?</strong></p><p name="f058" id="f058" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, there are many good answers. We need more kids learning to code. More investment in tech education. And more tech graduates from universities.</p><p name="361e" id="361e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what about this answer?</p><p name="d554" id="d554" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“What if we remove the barriers for women becoming tech professionals?”</strong></p><h3 name="60e6" id="60e6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Barriers? What barriers?</h3><p name="7eec" id="7eec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Is there any data supporting this “barriers” theory?</strong></p><p name="0042" id="0042" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Good numbers are hard to come by. Especially for Sri Lanka. There have been few surveys, with few participating companies. Definitions are vague, and few differentiate between A-Grade SWEs and lower quality candidates.</p><p name="801b" id="801b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But extrapolating several sources, I came up with this narrative. See this more as direction and descriptive, and less as rigorous and quantitative.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b690" id="b690" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Half of O.Level students are female; a much smaller proportion consider studies in tech.</li><li name="276f" id="276f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Female undergraduates in tech fields are far more likely not to enter the tech job market. Only 20% of Junior SWEs are female.</li><li name="f8f7" id="f8f7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Female Junior SWEs are less likely to become Mid-Level SWEs. Only 10% of Mid-Level SWEs are female.</li><li name="74ae" id="74ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Female Mid-Level SWEs are far less likely to become Senior SWEs. Only 5% of Senior-Level SWEs are female.</li></ul><figure name="83c9" id="83c9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*v_7j1WcRhTO3VSjr_Qi80A.png" data-width="2202" data-height="1236" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*v_7j1WcRhTO3VSjr_Qi80A.png"></figure><p name="1452" id="1452" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Hence, at every step of the pipeline, female potential drops out. Again, remember my caveat on the quality of the data. But this is not hard to verify. Walk into any Software Company, and what do you see? Almost only males. Hence, barriers must exist.</p><p name="ab36" id="ab36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, how do we remove the barriers? Let’s start by analysing the different steps in the pipeline.</p><h3 name="7344" id="7344" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 1: Secondary School to University</h3><p name="8880" id="8880" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Female students are less likely to pick the “Physical Science” or “Maths” A. level stream than males. Why?</p><p name="dfe9" id="dfe9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ignorance? Many parents and teachers feel that girls are less suited for tech and mathematics. Compared to boys. Hence, they encourage girls to pursue other fields instead of Physical Science. This prejudice shrinks female demand for the Physical Sciences. As a result, girls’ schools have fewer teachers, classes and facilities. The lack of facilities leads fewer girls picking the physical sciences. Reinforcing the initial prejudice: “girls are less suited for tech and mathematics”. The cycle continues.</p><p name="8688" id="8688" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do parents and teachers hold these views?</strong></p><p name="3d66" id="3d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data is scarce and theories are vague. One theory is that “Engineering” is a “man’s” field. Like a Steam Engine “Engineer” shovelling coal into a furnace. While women (supposedly) prefer “softer” and creative fields, now, I don’t see why women shouldn’t shovel coal. But more to the point, professions don’t get much “softer” than caressing keyboards and creating “soft”-ware. And few professions are more creative. Writing code is a sort of alchemy. Where one creates wondrous things out of nothing.</p><p name="28d4" id="28d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What the profession lacks is not softness or creativity. What it lacks is brand. The SWE Industry should lead the battle against this ignorance. Female leaders could evangelise tech in their former schools. Customised plans should target parents, teaches, and students. These plans should target the tail-end of O. Levels, since it is here that students make vital decisions.</p><p name="4afe" id="4afe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In parallel, we should lobby for more maths teachers and classes in girls’ schools.</p><h3 name="add0" id="add0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 2: University to Junior SWEs</h3><p name="1074" id="1074" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do female tech graduates shy away from the industry?</strong></p><p name="f3bc" id="f3bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is not “dropping out” of university. Tech “Drop out” rates in Sri Lanka are low for both sexes. But while almost all-male graduates enter the SWE job market, half of females don’t.</p><p name="fc78" id="fc78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is the SWE profession itself. It is very much a “Boys Club”. The vibe of the tech company office resembles a classroom in a boys’ school. The few women tend to congregate in a corner, trying best to avoid the noise and “locker room” banter. Even the term “Hacker” is far more “male” than, say, Doctor or Lawyer.</p><p name="b7d6" id="b7d6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Work Longer, Not Smarter” is the philosophy of many Junior SWE roles. Often middle-level managers measure new SWEs by how late they stay in the office. Code committed at two in the morning scores a lot of points. Tech companies don’t realise the cost of this lack of Work-Life balance. For males, it reduces productivity and future potential. For females, it often wholly discourages candidates from taking the job to start with. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why pick a job where you have no life when there are plenty of better jobs?</strong></p><p name="95a0" id="95a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some claim that female graduates prefer academia to SWE roles. But academia is merely another particular case of another “better job”.</p><p name="f24d" id="f24d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tech Companies should move away from <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Work Longer, Not Smarter” </strong>for the sake of both males and females. In the medium to long term, it serves no one. In the short term, it might be a cheap way of completing BPO projects, that involve the mechanical translation of “requirements” into code. But those days are over. To succeed, tech companies must exploit human creativity, not brute-force (mostly male) labour. And that is all about working smarter. You can’t be creative if you don’t have a life or lack sleep.</p><p name="40d5" id="40d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tech has a diversity problem globally, which reflects in the one-sided products it builds. Diversity is not just a problem across sexes, but within sexes as well. Male SWEs tend to skew to “specialists” with little knowledge and interests outside their field. Many lack essential communication and social skills. Working with such “Dilberts” is, to put it bluntly, boring. This culture of bores discourages others (including “generalist” males). It also degrades the quality of software development. Hence, diversity is not a fad. The lack of it has real costs.</p><p name="df90" id="df90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The obvious way for tech to fix a big portion of its diversity problem is to hire more female SWEs. This is not about lowering the bar. But being smarter about recruiting. For example, if a team or company has at least one woman, other women are far more likely to join that group. Hence, all teams should have a “critical goal” of reaching that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“one woman critical mass”</strong>. Similarly, when women conduct interviews, other women tend to perform better. And are far more likely to join. New SWEs get deep impressions of the company from interviews. The list of “fixes” is endless.</p><p name="8326" id="8326" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Parallel to these structural changes, tech must improve its image and brand. Particularly within universities. Female undergraduates need female role models. Universities should have more female lecturers and guest lectures from female industry leaders.</p><h3 name="b4f6" id="b4f6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 3: Junior SWEs to Mid-Level SWEs</h3><p name="a50d" id="a50d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After a few years of experience, the entry-level SWE acquires various “non-academic” skills. They gain more independence; the ability to do things without being told. They acquire an ability to answer questions which are not asked: “What new systems and products should be built?”. They increase the size of the “big picture” that they see. Hence, mid-level SWEs move beyond mere technical skill and competence. They understand products, business and people better.</p><p name="73d8" id="73d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While a large proportion of male junior SWEs reach the mid-level, more than half of women drop off. The leading cause is, again, Work-Life Balance. Especially around marraige and maternity.</p><p name="9758" id="9758" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is sickening how so many “industry leaders” have Victorian views: “We don’t want to hire women, because they get married and have babies”. And I hear it often, even in (supposedly) 21st-century tech companies.</p><p name="8cf4" id="8cf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These prejudices are, at best, unscientific. Consider a woman’s career. Suppose it spans from age 25 to 55. Suppose the woman has two children. And that six months of maternity leave follows each birth. That is one year in 30 or 3.3%. Is that such a significant loss? How does this compare to vacation and sick leave?</p><p name="14e0" id="14e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “problem” with maternity is that it is conspicuous. And being away for six months of baby leave is more visible than goofing-off on a Monday morning due to heavy drinking with the “boys” the previous night. Alcohol is considered a “positive” in many tech companies, and a massive part of “culture” and “team bonding”. The same “leaders” who complain about women having babies are happy to overlook male drunken idleness.</p><p name="1193" id="1193" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The benefits of better Work-Life balance, I’ve already explained. Tech companies should also help balance the burden of raising children. Paternity leave is an obvious step in this direction.</p><p name="6f13" id="6f13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But industry leaders should begin with themselves. And change their Victorian minds.</p><h3 name="1a47" id="1a47" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 4: Mid-Level SWEs to Senior SWEs</h3><p name="b594" id="b594" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Senior SWEs influence the long term direction of tech companies, and also the industry as a whole. Roles diverge into areas involving people management, product and business development. In Sri Lanka, there is a severe shortage of such people. Both male and female. The root cause is the lack of diversity at lower SWE levels. Note, this includes “intra-male” diversity. Too many male SWEs are “Dilberts”.</p><p name="4c4b" id="4c4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While there are few male Senior-SWEs, there are even fewer females. A few dozen across Sri Lanka, maybe. The shortage influences the whole pipeline. Female SWE candidates leave the profession for the lack of role models and favourable influence. Conversely, the lack of middle-level female SWEs causes a shortage of senior female SWEs. Another vicious cycle ensues.</p><p name="caa7" id="caa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Senior career progress hinges on a professional network. And sadly, Sri Lanka’s professional network is an “Old Boys’ Network”. With every connotation of that phrase. From school loyalties to drinking buddies. Not only in tech, but across the board.</p><p name="9a78" id="9a78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both “ends” of the problem needs solving. More junior and middle-level female SWEs graduating to the senior level will help. And the few senior females SWEs and leaders should continue to strengthen their networks, and help grow the pipeline.</p><h3 name="fb43" id="fb43" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Clarifications and Confessions</h3><p name="a147" id="a147" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Some consider diversity in general, and women’s empowerment in particular, a “fashion”. And some outwardly display interest for professional acceptance or other gains.</p><p name="c6ee" id="c6ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My goal in writing this article is not to join the fashion show. My motivations are entirely and sincerely selfish. My work suffers from the lack of SWEs (both male and female, at all levels). An obvious cure to this pain is to remove the barriers that women face.</p><p name="8bbb" id="8bbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like recruiting high-quality SWEs, the going has been tough. Few people believe there is a problem. Those who agree that there is a problem don’t know what to do. Those who know what to do, don’t want to do anything.</p><p name="66d2" id="66d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hopefully, this will change. Maybe someone reading this article will help?</p><p name="b16e" id="b16e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="cea6" id="cea6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Thanks </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanchana-ambagahawita-1b133a26/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanchana-ambagahawita-1b133a26/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Kanchana Ambagahawita</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> for proof-reading this article, and providing many valuable comments and insights]</em></p></div></div></section>
