That, I am not. I’m not even a Data Scientist. I run a tech consultancy, specialising in <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/the-three-pillars-of-ai-1dd30be82f5d" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/the-three-pillars-of-ai-1dd30be82f5d" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a> and Cryptography. That is my “day” job.</p><p name="02bf" id="02bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These days, I spend a lot of time interviewing and recruiting. <a href="https://medium.com/on-technology/on-swe-interviews-78dc8f5fe272" data-href="https://medium.com/on-technology/on-swe-interviews-78dc8f5fe272" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Software Engineers</a>, and some related roles like Product Managers and Data Scientists. Hiring suitable people is complex and challenging. And involves an elaborate “recruitment process”.</p><p name="129a" id="129a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On November 16th, I’ll be participating in another job interview. An interview for the most important job in Sri Lanka. CEO of Sri Lanka Inc. The 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election. So will many of you.</p><figure name="2260" id="2260" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*7HtpjOzf-ps0W3bPl0-mUg.png" data-width="1648" data-height="900" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7HtpjOzf-ps0W3bPl0-mUg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">On November 16th, I’ll be participating in another job interview.</figcaption></figure><p name="d4d3" id="d4d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In this article, I compare and contrast the method I use for recruiting Software Engineers (aka SWEs), to the method <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we</em> use for recruiting Presidents.</p><h3 name="828e" id="828e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Resumes</h3><p name="92d6" id="92d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">SWE resumes usually consist of Academic Record and Job Experience. Note, this is a “past” record. Few SWEs spend resume-space talking about the degrees or Nobel prizes, or the many CTO or engineering directorships they expect to get in the next five years. Or the next 100 days for that matter.</p><p name="1d89" id="1d89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This “past” is easy to verify. If there is a ridiculous claim in a resume, a quick web search, or call will confirm or deny it.</p><p name="782a" id="782a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, “Resumes” for Presidential Candidates, almost wholly consist of the “future”. “Manifestos” manifest with all manner of amazingness and goodies the candidates expect to do as soon as they are elected. Anything from 100 day plans to 5-year plans.</p><p name="17d6" id="17d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why don’t we scrutinise candidates’ past more? You might argue that both Mr Premadasa and Mr Rajapaksa (to name just two) are “first-time” candidates. They don’t have a “past record”.</p><p name="c0ec" id="c0ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But of course they do have pasts. Very colorful ones too. And even if they don’t have pasts, when we elect a President, we won’t be choosing just one candidate. We elect a vast entourage of other politicians, lackeys, groupies and goons. They all have pasts.</p><h3 name="c09f" id="c09f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">References</h3><p name="f630" id="f630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most SWEs list a professor or a previous boss as a “reference”, complete with contact details. These people are usually happy to provide information on the candidate. I myself have acted as “reference” to many former colleagues. Referees are typically selected to support the candidate. A SWE won’t add a boss they hate as a referee.</p><p name="fd15" id="fd15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Getting the Presidential Job is hard work. The campaign (probably) costs 100s of millions of rupees. And perhaps a few million dollars, dinars, and euros for good measure as well.</p><p name="3092" id="3092" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like SWEs, Presidential candidates also have “professors” and bosses standing behind them. Happy to support them with rupees and dollars as required. At a modest interest rate, of course.</p><p name="279d" id="279d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, unlike SWEs, Presidential hopefuls tend not to mention these references. It would be nice to have a tabulated list of “references” complete with contact details and campaign contributions. But I’m yet to see any list. Probably the references are “very busy”.</p><h3 name="c089" id="c089" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Interviews</h3><p name="7ef5" id="7ef5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A SWE candidate could go through up to 10 hours of interviews. By several interviewers. Some over the phone. Some in person.</p><p name="4208" id="4208" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These interviews are dialogues. Where both interviewers and interviewees get to take questions and give answers.</p><p name="5e9a" id="5e9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So far, most of the “interviews” of presidential candidates I’ve seen are “monologues”. They usually get on a stage and talk to a couple of thousand people. Sometimes more. These interviews are telecast over the media and are available on YouTube etc.</p><p name="6001" id="6001" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why not move away from monologues to dialogues? Town-hall style? Where a bunch of voters can be picked at random, and spend a couple of hours with the candidate asking them questions? Media organisations could follow this style too.</p><h3 name="8c71" id="8c71" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Diversity</h3><p name="5e0f" id="5e0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">About 30% of Sri Lankan computer science and engineering graduates are female (depending on how you count). However, only about 20% of junior SWEs are female, indicating that many female graduates opt for non-SWE jobs. The proportion drops to 10% with senior SWEs, and 5% with highly skilled SWEs, with post-graduate qualifications.</p><p name="e0fc" id="e0fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is not with females, but with the industry itself. Various aspects of tech-company “Bro-Culture” from the office environment, to benefits, to work hours, are highly male-biased. Hence, tech has an enormous diversity problem and is effectively excluding 50+% of the population. Many of us are doing our best to fix the problem, but a lot remains to be done.</p><p name="73ee" id="73ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you think 5% is wrong, then consider 2.8%. This is the portion of female candidates for the November 16th election. Namely, 1 out of 35. Sausage-Fest alert!</p><h3 name="734a" id="734a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Thoughts</h3><p name="1ee3" id="1ee3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If I reviewed our Presidential Candidates (SWE interview style), I’d make the following notes:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2b18" id="2b18" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Resume only talks about the future. Cannot be verified.</li><li name="6ac1" id="6ac1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">References, omitted.</li><li name="7592" id="7592" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Interviews, one-sided monologues.</li><li name="6a94" id="6a94" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Diversity, none.</li></ul><p name="2b71" id="2b71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">My conclusion would be: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Insufficient information and diversity. Please fix recruiting process.</strong></p><p name="d313" id="d313" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you think I’m trivialising our democracy by comparing it to tech recruiting, could you explain to me what I’m missing? Why should a more critical job have a utterly trivial recruitment process?</p><p name="f1f6" id="f1f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you tell me that you’re not a company founder and don’t need to bother about recruiting, you’re wrong.</p><p name="fd26" id="fd26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every Sri Lankan citizen is a shareholder in Sri Lanka Inc. We are all part of the corporation’s decisions. Including hiring the CEO. Which is what we’ll be doing in two Saturdays.</p><p name="cadf" id="cadf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Happy Recruiting!</p></div></div></section>
