For example, “the sun rose from the east today”.</p><p name="6275" id="6275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A theory generalizes a set of facts. For example, after observing the sun rising from the east, every day for several years, a caveman might generalize, “the sun rises from the east”.</p><h3 name="ebfb" id="ebfb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Falsification</h3><p name="b235" id="b235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A theory assumes that what we know for observed facts, must be valid for unobserved situations. For example, “the sun rises from the east” implies “the sun will rise from the east, tomorrow”.</p><p name="4b82" id="4b82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If an unobserved situation contradicts a theory in the future, we say that the “theory is falsified”, or is shown to be false. For example, if the sun explodes sometime today.</p><p name="0e97" id="0e97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, a theory can never be proved correct. It can only be proved false.</p><h3 name="cd3d" id="cd3d" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Back-up” Connections</h3><p name="fec9" id="fec9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Why do we accept a theory? Like “the sun rises from the east”? Is it only based on the many observations of the sun rising from the east?</p><p name="85ea" id="85ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not quite. This theory connects to other theories. Like “the earth rotates around its axis”. “Because the earth rotates around its axis” is a reasonable answer to the question, “Why does the sunrise from the east?”</p><p name="5567" id="5567" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, theories “back-up” other theories. Which further back-up theories. But this still doesn’t make the theory “true”. Because the “back-up” theories are also theories. Which might be falsified by future observations.</p><p name="558f" id="558f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, the “back-up” makes a theory a “better theory”. Or at least it feels that way, intuitively.</p><p name="9466" id="9466" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then, what exactly is a “better theory”?</p><h3 name="e64d" id="e64d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The “perfect” theory</h3><p name="dff7" id="dff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The “perfect” theory is one which can be derived entirely from facts, without generalization.</p><p name="8c36" id="8c36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, suppose you “observe” that “a number that is a multiple of four and six, seems to be a multiple of 12” often. And you conclude “any number that is a multiple of four and six, is a multiple of 12”. This “theory” is “ideal” because you can “prove it mathematically” from “first principles” or “axioms”.</p><p name="a28c" id="a28c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Perfect” theories like this are restricted to “formal sciences” like mathematics and statistics. As the subject increases in complexity, from mathematics to physics to chemistry to biology, and so on, it becomes harder and hard to build a theory from first principles.</p><p name="8607" id="8607" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even in physics, there have been many instances where we thought we had the “perfect” theory, only for one observation to falsify it. The most famous example is probably Newton’s laws of motion, which were believed to be “perfect” until Quantum Theory falsified them several centuries later.</p><p name="9d38" id="9d38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Strictly speaking, there are no “perfect theories” even in mathematics, because the “first principles” or “axioms” are not pure facts. For example, in Euclidean (or “classical”) geometry, we assume that two parallel lines never meet. Riemannian geometry does not assume this. Even “1 + 1 = 2” is based on a set of axioms in set theory, upon which number theory and arithmetic are built.</p><p name="7d6f" id="7d6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Axioms can be dangerous, especially when we force ourselves (and others) to accept a flimsy theory, as an axiom.</p><h3 name="ed59" id="ed59" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A “not bad” theory</h3><p name="ccce" id="ccce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">While Quantum Theory proved Newton “wrong”, his Laws of Motion are still useful. Because they are a “good enough” approximation in most situations. For example, if you’re an engineer computing a car’s braking distance, Newton is more than sufficient.</p><p name="f495" id="f495" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, a theory need not be “perfect”. It only needs to be good enough. Or possibly, “not bad”.</p><p name="e9ba" id="e9ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How to we test if a theory is “not bad” or not?</p><p name="0dd3" id="0dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We could compare a theory to a “bad theory”, and if the “bad theory” is as good, we could conclude that it is not a “not bad” theory.</p><p name="35f9" id="35f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do we do this? Statistics provides an excellent technique.</p><h3 name="d72e" id="d72e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Hypothesis Testing</h3><p name="7244" id="7244" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Statistical Hypothesis testing consists of two hypotheses: The “Null Hypothesis” and the “Alternative Hypothesis”. The latter is the theory you want to test. The former is the “bad theory” for comparison.</p><p name="0aae" id="0aae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was talking to an Economist about a particular development strategy X. “Why does it work?”, I asked. The Econ explained that ten countries adopted it, and seven countries observed significant development. Let’s use this episode as a “case study”.</p><p name="d810" id="d810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “theory” here is:</p><blockquote name="58f2" id="58f2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“X results in development”.</blockquote><p name="4091" id="4091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And that will be our “Alternative Hypothesis”. Let me propose the following “bad” theory, as the “Null Hypothesis”:</p><blockquote name="59ed" id="59ed" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Development has nothing to do with X. Instead, God says, “I’m going to toss a fair coin. Once per country. HEADS, and I grant development. TAILS and I grant no development”</blockquote><p name="3706" id="3706" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Alternatively, if you are an atheist, or believe that God doesn’t toss,</p><blockquote name="58c9" id="58c9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Development has nothing to do with X. Each country has a 50% chance of achieving development.”</blockquote><p name="eaf1" id="eaf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This type of “random” bad theory, is widespread in statistics</p><p name="f689" id="f689" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do we test if the “bad theory” is as good as our theory? Simple, we see if the bad theory might explain the observations. Or “what is the chance that the coin-tossing God might explain the 7/10 outcomes?”</p><p name="6956" id="6956" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A simple calculation will tell you that with the “bad theory”, the probability of 7 or more countries developing is about 17%. Hence, we see that the “bad theory” explains the observations.</p><figure name="6e3f" id="6e3f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aivxMDPNXtOWFsaUxR9PVQ.png" data-width="2366" data-height="1056" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aivxMDPNXtOWFsaUxR9PVQ.png"></figure><p name="0dc0" id="0dc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">But is 17% enough?</p><p name="3767" id="3767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In practice, we use much smaller numbers like 1%, 5% or 10%. The smaller the number, the more we favour the “Null Hypothesis” or “bad theory”. And the smaller the number, the more “not bad” the “Alternative Hypothesis” is. We refer to this limit as the “Significance” of the Test. Alternatively, we might report the (100% — Significance), known as the “Confidence” of the test. 5% Significance is equivalent to 95% Confidence.</p><p name="cb73" id="cb73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Econ’s theory won’t pass a 5% or 10% Test.</p><h3 name="5460" id="5460" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Statistics is too strict.”</h3><p name="2ab4" id="2ab4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But you might say, “It would pass a 20% test. Wouldn’t it? Was our 5% or 10% bar too strict?”</p><p name="4892" id="4892" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suppose we lived in 1900. And suppose we were trying to test Newton’s Laws of Motion. We run 100 experiments, and all return the correct result. At what significance would this series of experiments pass a statistical test?</p><p name="54a2" id="54a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we use our “random bad test” as the “Null Hypothesis”, the significance is the probability of getting 100,000 heads while tossing a coin. This probability is “zero point zero thirty-one times followed by a seven” or almost zero.</p><p name="0db1" id="0db1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, a properly good theory will not only pass a 5% test; it will pass a much stricter test.</p><h3 name="1227" id="1227" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Bad” is relative</h3><p name="9d90" id="9d90" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“Newtonian Physics might demand an almost zero significance. But isn’t 17% sufficient for Economics?”, you counter.</p><p name="da9a" id="da9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you might be right. Different fields seem to have different opinions and on “significance”. We might even “classify” academic fields on his basis:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4ead" id="4ead" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Formal Sciences: 0%</li><li name="5798" id="5798" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Physics: Almost 0%</li><li name="a69d" id="a69d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Chemistry: &lt;1%</li><li name="3411" id="3411" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Biology: &lt;5%</li><li name="8e0a" id="8e0a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Medicine: &lt;10%</li><li name="2f81" id="2f81" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Social “Sciences”: &gt;10%</li></ul><figure name="812a" id="812a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aG3Jb89V0cQ0KrOrAKo-3Q.jpeg" data-width="1173" data-height="622" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aG3Jb89V0cQ0KrOrAKo-3Q.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="db57" id="db57" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">An Alternative to Social “Science”</h3><p name="8aa7" id="8aa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’d notice that I don’t list the “humanities” above. This is because the humanities don’t propound “scientific” theories. When they do propose theories, they are descriptive and qualitative. They seldom involve the “scientific method” and “falsification”. Theories in humanities have some aspect of generalization, but these are more summaries, as opposed to general theories.</p><p name="3310" id="3310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, this lack of “science” doesn’t make the humanities less useful. They are far more helpful because they are intellectually honest. They don’t make false claims.</p><p name="aa79" id="aa79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Social Sciences also had their roots in sociology, which was a part of the humanities, and followed the tradition of “non-scientific” study.</p><p name="0f97" id="0f97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sadly, starting in the 19th century, and possibly driven by envy for the newly emergent Chemistry and Physics, sociologists rebranded as social “science”. The rebranding reached new heights when in the early 20th century Economists annotated itself the “New Physics”. Classical Economists minimized complex processes into simple equations. Not only did they win unparalleled influence among leaders and politicians, but self-celebrated their success to levels never seen before. They even granted themselves a Pseudo-Nobel Prize (proper title: “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_Memorial_Prize_laureates_in_Economics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_Memorial_Prize_laureates_in_Economics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sveriges</strong> Riksbank Prize</a>”).</p><p name="212c" id="212c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happily, beginning in the late 20 century, Economics and other social “sciences” are finding their way again. Economists recognize their proper place among academic disciplines, and place themselves above medicine and psychology, instead of next to physics. This reflects in 21st century Sveriges Riksbank Prize winners, like Daniel Kahneman (2002) and Robert Schiller (2013). Conversely, many of the winners of the 20th century have been debunked and forgotten.</p><h3 name="ce05" id="ce05" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Concluding “Bad” Theory</h3><p name="e1b2" id="e1b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Sadly, there are still many Social “Scientists” around. I have my own “bad” theory on why.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0ff8" id="0ff8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Those who understand statistics won’t study Economics, Politics or Sociology as a “science”. They would either research their pure scientific basis (like Kahneman) or as humanity (like Schiller), or do something else.</li><li name="9f3f" id="9f3f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Hence, those who do study Economics, Politics or Sociology as “science” don’t understand statistics.</li><li name="22bc" id="22bc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Hence, as long as there are people who don’t understand statistics, there is always the danger of Social “Sciences”, and their fallout.</li></ul></div></div></section>
