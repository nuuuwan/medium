The 90% of the social media traffic around Sri Lankan’s ongoing Constitutional gymnastics falls into this “He said, She said” category.</p><p name="eb39" id="eb39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My first reaction to this is frustration — especially when I don’t agree with ABC, but also in cases when I do agree — but feel it lacks detail or nuance or context.</p><blockquote name="b3c4" id="b3c4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why?” [You might ask] “These people are not posting under oath?

The visibility of this statement (in turn) is tied to the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">popularity of PQR</strong>. A special case of this is when PQR and XYZ is one and the same; the words and deeds of famous people get a lot of airing on social media.</p><p name="b09c" id="b09c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem with all this is that XYZ is judged on <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">authority and popularity</strong>; not <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">rationality</strong>. An “authoritative” or popular person’s lie is truer than an unknown person’s truth.

Going to the doctor’s is very different.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ffb3" id="ffb3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Doctors have qualifications. The institutions giving these qualifications are regulated. The said doctors and institutions can be sued if they malpractice. On the other hand, many commentators on the internet have dubious qualifications. The memes and sound-bites they produce are more like candy or cocaine, than a medical prescription; they give you a quick dopamine rush, are easy to hide, and have delayed and little understood negative effects. You can’t sue an internet celebrity for lying or misleading. You can’t even question or contradict them — because your reply will only be seen by your 10 best friends, and none of their 10 Million fans. To summarize, the medical profession has checks and balances (literally as well as figuratively). Social media does not.</li><li name="84f4" id="84f4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If you have a complex disease you can and should do some research, discuss at length, and even get multiple “second opinions”. Given that health is important, most people are willing to put in the extra work. On the other hand, few people (deep down) really care about quality and truth on the internet. There is little checking, and validation. In other words, people take quality in the medical profession seriously. Few people take the effects of social media seriously, until the patient is already terminally ill.</li></ul><h4 name="76fe" id="76fe" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">OBJECTION 2: Suppose (for a moment) that we agree that something is wrong.

The statements 1 and 2 are also different in that 1 refers to a specific aspect of social media, and 2 is general; and “political, social and economic problems” is easier to observe and measure than ““He said, She said” make poor data-points”.</p><p name="9b3e" id="9b3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, 2 is a delayed effect of 1 (and many quirks like it). This is difficult to measure without a lot of data, but many early studies already confirm it. Like smoking, the process of realization might be slow, painful, and punctuated with controversy. But the faster it happens the less people will die.</p><h4 name="7ae3" id="7ae3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">OBJECTION 3: Suppose you were right.
