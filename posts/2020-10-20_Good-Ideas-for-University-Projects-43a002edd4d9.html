This article is a summary of what I (usually) end-up telling them.</p><h3 name="df44" id="df44" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Why University Projects</strong></h3><p name="a629" id="a629" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For most people, University Projects are a mere requirement. It’s something they “have to do” to get their undergraduate or post-graduate degree. But there are many other reasons for doing University Projects and doing them well.</p><h4 name="4380" id="4380" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Solving problems you care about</h4><p name="9d3d" id="9d3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The two most common questions I get about ML and AI, are “What are the most important technologies?” and “What courses should I take?” My answer to both these questions is the same: “Forget about technology and courses to start with. Instead, find a problem that you care about. Then, see how you might apply technology or knowledge gained from courses to solve that problem”.</p><p name="62e1" id="62e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">University Projects are an excellent medium for solving problems that you care about. And beyond merely satisfying your course requirements, that’s an excellent reason for completing a project.</p><h4 name="8c96" id="8c96" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Building Visibility</h4><p name="4789" id="4789" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you are planning on pursuing “higher studies” beyond your bachelors or masters, your adviser would probably advise you to “publish a few papers” based on your university project. This is indeed a good reason, as often the project and any resulting papers will feature prominently in a post-graduate university application.</p><p name="4b9b" id="4b9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Beyond this academic visibility, projects are also a useful means of professional and industrial visibility. When I’m scanning through resumes to hire software engineers or data scientists, a good university project will boost the candidate to the top of my priority list. University projects carry a lot more weight than (say) high GPAs; they are far more relevant to the real-world.</p><h4 name="bf2f" id="bf2f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Converting into a bigger thing</h4><p name="6c1b" id="6c1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Many real-world businesses have been born out of university projects. The most famous example is probably Google. Not only did Brin and Page become multi-billionaires, but so did several of their advisors at Stanford, and some of their batchmates.</p><p name="1150" id="1150" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A “bigger-thing” might not necessarily be monetary. For example, you could convert your university project into an open-source project. While it might not turn you into a Billionaire, it could still potentially benefit thousands or even millions people.</p><h4 name="eba0" id="eba0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Winning awards</h4><p name="3b9b" id="3b9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There are many competitions for university projects, and the winners get a lot of publicity, monetary or other rewards, and often both.</p><h3 name="9477" id="9477" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How to come up with good university project ideas?</h3><p name="93c9" id="93c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The previous “Why” section meant to be a “generator” for this “How” section. Each “Why” serves as a mechanism to generate “Hows”.</p><p name="9e40" id="9e40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ask yourself the following questions:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="37fa" id="37fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">What real-world problems do I care about? How might I “formulate it” as a university project?</li><li name="9885" id="9885" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What are some interesting research papers? What are similar topics?</li><li name="1c5f" id="1c5f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What might be a potentially exciting business idea? Can a university project be a basis for testing such an idea?</li><li name="2862" id="2862" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What are some interesting open-source projects related to my academic interests?</li><li name="d458" id="d458" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">What are some good competitions for university projects?
