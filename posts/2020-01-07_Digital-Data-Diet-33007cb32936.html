Her six grandchildren, three children and their spouses were treating her to lunch. At a colourful restaurant.</p><p name="a593" id="a593" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The adults seemed happy enough. The children were bizarrely silent. Watching a set of squeaking cartoon characters bump about a screen. Each peering into a phone or tablet. Their <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">own</em> phone or tablet.</p><p name="9b70" id="9b70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The restaurant had a comprehensive menu. And a large subset was ordered “family style”. But this was for the adults.</p><p name="b6d0" id="b6d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The kids had their own “kids menu”. Their lunch was as mundane. They hardly looked at their food. From time to time, a disinterested parent would shovel a load of potato chips or chicken nuggets (the two items on the “Kids Menu”) into their limp mouths. The cartoon characters continued to squeak. And the kids continued to peer like zombies.</p><figure name="c247" id="c247" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ap8SIDNrr98Za2OthmR0bw.jpeg" data-width="480" data-height="300" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ap8SIDNrr98Za2OthmR0bw.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="df1c" id="df1c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">This Article: An Analogy</h3><p name="46c6" id="46c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This article is not about kids addicted to screens. Or junk food. But it is about the connection between screens and junk food.</p><p name="a021" id="a021" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The acceleration of technology has resulted in many challenges. Which we are struggling to understand and counter. On the other hand, we humans have been eating food well before we were humans. While we also have many problems with food, we understand food a lot better than technology.</p><p name="323b" id="323b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What can our understanding of food, teach us about technology? And the consumption of data?</p><p name="574f" id="574f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this article, I ponder these questions from a government’s or state’s point of view. More specifically, the Sri Lankan state.</p><p name="406a" id="406a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Can its policies around food, nutrition and health, influence its policies around technology and data?</strong></p><h3 name="bb93" id="bb93" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Modern Farming</h3><p name="9df6" id="9df6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Food begins with farming. If agriculture is efficient, food is likely to be better in both quality and quantity. More quality and quantity would promote value addition. And a more vibrant economy around food. For example, there would be more restaurants and a “food culture”.</p><p name="d9ea" id="d9ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suppose you visit a Sri Lankan government department. Say to fix some anomaly in your pension. You will consume and interact with a lot of data. But most of this data is “non-digital”. Data input is by hand. Filling paper forms. These forms add to larger batches of forms. Usually stored in several paper “files”. Output consists of reading these files. And “data processing” happens in the minds of humans.</p><p name="389b" id="389b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be fair, this system works reasonably well. And it does have advantages. It is (probably) impossible for a hacker in Eastern Ukraine to nobble your pension numbers. Just as many ancient farming techniques are healthier and even <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">organic</em>. But like ancient farming techniques, these systems are slow. And expensive. And inefficient.</p><p name="f255" id="f255" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider all “data interactions” (input, processing and output) the ordinary Sri Lankan has. From pensions to banking, to welfare, to health, to transport. A significant part of these involves “ancient farming techniques”.</p><figure name="4d00" id="4d00" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uY916dAkhHkBL3X_tEWelw.png" data-width="1180" data-height="359" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uY916dAkhHkBL3X_tEWelw.png"></figure><h3 name="a256" id="a256" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Food Distribution</h3><p name="0f5c" id="0f5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Suppose all our farmers produced all the food Sri Lanka needed. Using the most efficient and modern farming techniques. Enough to make Sri Lanka self-sufficient in food. And a surplus to support value-added exports. Not only do we have all the rice we need, but we also dominate the market in organic rice noodles and rice crispies.</p><p name="a3b6" id="a3b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what if our roads and rail networks were crappy? What if all the rice never left the farms? All modern farming would go to waste.</p><p name="4ec9" id="4ec9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same applies to data. Even if all government services are digital and digitalised, they are wasted if citizens cannot access them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Less than 35%</a> of Sri Lankan citizens have internet access. Those who aren’t, cannot optimally utilise digital services.</p><p name="ab27" id="ab27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is not purely about infrastructure. Like our rice distribution and transport is controlled by monopolistic businessmen with political connections, telecommunications infrastructure suffers from quasi-oligopolistic control. We need more competition and freer markets. And regulation that would enable this.</p><p name="0616" id="0616" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We also need more “food-technologist” and “farmers” for digital data. People who design new types of data, design them and grow them. In other words, application designers, product managers and software engineers.</p><figure name="bc3b" id="bc3b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*POqoPtTVjyZn-YgyxtyUMw.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="525" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*POqoPtTVjyZn-YgyxtyUMw.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="84e6" id="84e6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">2000 K. Calories Per Day</h3><p name="34b6" id="34b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Despite being connected, many Sri Lankans cannot afford data. And hence can’t make the best use of tech and its applications. Food is available. But it is too expensive for too many. Hence, many Sri Lankans don’t meet their “data” needs. Like many Sri Lankans (particularly Children) don’t meet their calorific needs.</p><p name="ea05" id="ea05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Network bandwidth and data should not be the luxury it is. These days, it is a commodity. Like rice or dhal. Not a luxury item. Like fine wines or caviar.</p><p name="c722" id="c722" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the government has goals around nutrition and calorific intake, why not goals around internet data access? For example, what if (for “starters”) every citizen has access to 1GB of data per day?</p><figure name="9ac3" id="9ac3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oIX1pMiuZ11wLdpmKK3nmQ.jpeg" data-width="673" data-height="459" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oIX1pMiuZ11wLdpmKK3nmQ.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="0a2d" id="0a2d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">A Balanced Diet</h3><p name="41e9" id="41e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But there is no point in giving citizens 1GB per day if that is entirely spent on Facebook, YouTube or Gossip LK. Like 2000 K. Calories entirely composed of refined sugar and crisps (or chips and nuggets, for that matter). Hence, the digital diet needs to be balanced.</p><p name="e5b5" id="e5b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we do understand that fresh fruits and vegetables are healthy, we don’t have a good sense of what precisely makes a healthy “digital diet”. However, our understanding is steadily improving. We know that a lot of social media content is like sugar. We get an instant-dopamine boost and a sudden crash. Leading to an immediate need for more. We have a much better understanding of how some content is addictive. Like cocaine or heroin. We also know that certain types of data, like long-form content (e.g. academic courses, and medium articles😉), is “good for you”.</p><p name="f2a1" id="f2a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, just as governments educate citizens on good food, they could educate on useful data.</p><p name="b06b" id="b06b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as we need more Nutritionists, Doctors and Therapists, food-wise, we need people equivalent “data-employees”. We need people who can advise citizens on how to use data and get the most out of it. We need psychologists and therapists who can help people deal with the fallout. Like the sad kids at Grandma’s 70th.</p><figure name="a81c" id="a81c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JM1LNhCT2P1P32mmdZyVFw.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="700" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JM1LNhCT2P1P32mmdZyVFw.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="aa0e" id="aa0e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Food Imports and Exports</h3><p name="77d4" id="77d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most software used in Sri Lanka, both in the public and private sector, is designed and manufactured abroad. A lot of the raw data consumed also originates overseas. That’s like importing all of our food from foreigners.</p><p name="e8c9" id="e8c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as many countries exploit our “third world” status and export us “third-grade” food, a lot of the software we buy is also “third class”. But we are happy to smack our lips and pay millions. Because “they are foreign” and hence “must be good”.</p><p name="6fc0" id="6fc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, just as we should be mindful of our export and imports of food (and other goods and services), we should be aware of our “software and data trade deficit”. Any government in its right mind would want a plan that could turn the deficit into a surplus.</p><figure name="e13e" id="e13e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dTHbVzZMZHJVBCh7xX5BOw.jpeg" data-width="308" data-height="164" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dTHbVzZMZHJVBCh7xX5BOw.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="f458" id="f458" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Summary Recommendations</h3><p name="9667" id="9667" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Suppose Sri Lanka had a “Digital Data” version of the Ministries of Agriculture, Health and Nutrition. They should consider the following questions:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1e48" id="1e48" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">What proportion of government processes use “Modern Farming”? How might the proportion increase?</li><li name="4670" id="4670" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How efficient is “Digital Data Distribution”? Is the market free? Are there monopolies? Is regulation needed?</li><li name="9ae3" id="9ae3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do all citizens have access? Is there malnutrition? Can every citizen have 1GB per day?</li><li name="06fc" id="06fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Are citizens getting a “Balanced Diet”? What about obesity and drug addictions? How do you deal with drug barons?</li><li name="53dc" id="53dc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How do we educate more Designers, Product Managers and Engineers? And “Digital Nutritionists” and “Therapists”?</li><li name="3aba" id="3aba" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Finally, how do we fix our huge Digital Software and Data Trade Deficit?</li></ul></div></div></section>
