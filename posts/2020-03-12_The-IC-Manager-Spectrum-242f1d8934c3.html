They design and implement systems; usually, by writing code.</p><p name="8c13" id="8c13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Managers contribute through “helping others contribute”. At Facebook [where I was both an IC and an Engineering Manager for eight-plus years], managers were supposed to support their managees (or reports), in four ways:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4bcb" id="4bcb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Provide Context. </strong>Help ICs understand how what they do connects to the “Big Picture”.</li><li name="5ff8" id="5ff8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Set Focus</strong>.

If the company credits a manager for all their ICs impact (as well as the ICs), there will be “double-counting”. Instead, the company rewards managers for the “incremental impact” their ICs make, compared to had the manager not existed.</p><p name="c71f" id="c71f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, managers needed one set of skills; ICs another. At least in theory.</p><h3 name="02c5" id="02c5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">In practice</strong></h3><p name="ae8e" id="ae8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There is no such thing as a 100% manager or a 100% IC. In practice, most people are somewhere in between.</p><p name="049c" id="049c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If a software engineer, mentors another, they are “managing” to some extent. Similarly, if a manager spends time designing a system or even writing code, they are “ICing”.</p><p name="a60b" id="a60b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As an IC gains experience, they tend to do more “managery” tasks, like mentoring. Facebook evaluated IC Engineers across three dimensions: 1) Technical; 2) Product; and 3) People. The “People” dimension had a substantial “management” component. The “weights” of the dimensions changed with the ICs experience. While a junior Engineer’s “People Dimension” might weigh 10%, it could be 50% or more for a senior engineer.</p><p name="7d0d" id="7d0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These “dimensions” reflected the diversity of expectations. The same applied for Managers.</p><h3 name="942d" id="942d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How to make this work</h3><p name="60a8" id="60a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Hence, in practice, there is a spectrum; from a “pure” IC to a “pure” manager. Whether or not the spectrum is effective, depends on how the company is organized and managed.</p><h4 name="6b72" id="6b72" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">1. Structure</h4><p name="768d" id="768d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Definitions of roles and levels must be consistent with an IC-Manager spectrum.</p><p name="1b85" id="1b85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In many organizations, managers are “above” ICs. ICs, once they reach a certain level, are “promoted” to management. In such an organization, an IC could take on some manager tasks, especially if they “aspire to management”. On the other hand, a manager doing IC work might be considered “beneath them”. This also resulted in senior ICs who could not progress further. These “dead-end ICs” tended to stagnate or leave the organization.</p><p name="7bfd" id="7bfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A better structure is one where ICs and managers are equal in level. For example, Facebook had the following structure. The company promoted ICs to more senior ICs, and managers to more senior managers, it never “promoted” ICs to management. When an IC became a manager (and vice versa), the move was known as a “transition”.</p><figure name="2e99" id="2e99" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*tgXYbkIG6Hxk9yKA2FY0Cw.png" data-width="1588" data-height="926" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tgXYbkIG6Hxk9yKA2FY0Cw.png"></figure><h4 name="c015" id="c015" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">2. Expectations</h4><p name="697e" id="697e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Setting the right expectation is critical. Managers at Facebook had an explicit “agreement” with their managers, about the IC-Manager Balance. Their performance was measured relative to that expectation.</p><p name="a3b3" id="a3b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While at Facebook, I moved back and forth through the spectrum: I was a 100% IC, a 100% Manager, a ~50% IC (with 50% “managing”) and a ~50% Manager (with 50% individual contributing); and a multitude of shades in-between.</p><h4 name="9012" id="9012" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">3. Roles</h4><p name="ed26" id="ed26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It is easier to be something if that something has a name.</p><p name="c7f3" id="c7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is a 50% manager/50% IC a “manager” or an “IC”?</p><p name="8e08" id="8e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the company would expect such an employee to make the same aggregate impact as a manager or IC at the same level, their impact purely as a manager, or IC would fall short of a 100% manager, or a 100% IC. Hence, they will be undervalued if they are judged relative to a “pure” role.</p><p name="7b03" id="7b03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At Facebook, these roles were known as “IC-Manager-Hybrid”. Expectations were accordingly set, and performance was relatively measured.</p><h3 name="b8ba" id="b8ba" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Thoughts</h3><p name="33fe" id="33fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The term “Manager” has some historical baggage. “ICs” were associated with the “working class”, and consigned to that lowly position for eternity. Managers were an elite, were often parachuted in from a different pool of candidates, often with different backgrounds and no “technical” qualifications. This historical class structure still prevails in many companies.</p><p name="eaff" id="eaff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tech Companies (or at least the better Tech Companies), on the other hand, have diverged from this model. Instead of a class system, status depends on impact. Hence, an IC making more impact than a manager holds a higher position.</p><p name="af14" id="af14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It probably boils down to what you value more. History appreciated a status quo; the modern tech company values impact.</p><p name="b84f" id="b84f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Finally, should an engineering manager write code?</strong></p><p name="825c" id="825c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The depends on two factors:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="399c" id="399c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Can the engineering manager write code?</strong> Any EM worth their salt should be able to write excellent code.</li><li name="a6c1" id="a6c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Does the company support it?</strong> The better tech companies do.
