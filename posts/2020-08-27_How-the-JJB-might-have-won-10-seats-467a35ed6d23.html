Winning only three seats, their disappointment was (probably) only second to the UNP (one seat).</p><p name="19a2" id="19a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The dissapointment might have been compounded by the fact that they came very close to winning more seats. In <a href="https://medium.com/on-politics/so-close-yet-so-far-d3bcdee54124" data-href="https://medium.com/on-politics/so-close-yet-so-far-d3bcdee54124" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">So close, yet so far</a> (where I describe how with a few more votes, various parties might have won more seats), the JJB represented three of my “Top 10 so close misses”.</p><p name="ea12" id="ea12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some might consider this “bad luck” — a misfortune. Others, however, might consider this “carelessness”. I count myself in the second camp. Here’s why: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">With a few more votes in a relative small selection of areas, they could have more than tripled their tally to 10 seats.</strong></p><p name="96b8" id="96b8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“But why flog a dead horse?”, you might ask. “The election is over”.</p><p name="cf5e" id="cf5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you’re partly right. There won’t be another parlimentary election for some time. Then, why am I writing this article? For three reasons:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="b2ac" id="b2ac" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Any party wishing to win any seats at the next parliamentary election, must begin preparing now. In this sense, JJB included, it’s never too early to start.</li><li name="9b95" id="9b95" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A party with ten seats in parliament has a lot more clout than one with three. Hence, if a party had a realistic chance of winning ten seats (and as we will see, the JJB had a realistic chance), they should take such opportunities very seriously.</li><li name="da1e" id="da1e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Even for larger parties, this exercise will be useful in determining which areas to focus on more, and which area less so.</li></ol><h4 name="113d" id="113d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">3 Seats (actual 2020 Result)</h4><p name="366b" id="366b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Let’s recap.

The JJB won 37,136 votes or 7.76% (well above the 5% limit).</p><p name="33a1" id="33a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, with just 7 seats allocated to the district (one of which is reserved for the winning party), 7.76% was not sufficient to win a single seat. This number was revised down from the 2015 General Election that had 8 seats allocated to Matara. In an 8-seat-Matara, the JJB would have won a seat.</p><p name="2985" id="2985" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, even with 7 seats for Matara, just 4,300 more votes (+12%), the JJB would have won a seat.

Like Matara, Hambantota had only 7 seats.</p><p name="3b63" id="3b63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With 4,200 votes (+13%, very similar to Matara), the JJB would have won a seat in Hambantota.

But hardly impossible.</p><p name="d60d" id="d60d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the Badulla District, the JJB got 19,308 votes or 3.87%. 6,000 more votes (+31% of 19,308) or a total of 25,308 votes, would have got them over the 5% line, and won them a seat.</p><p name="ae65" id="ae65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now you might argue that +31% is a tall order. In 2001, the JVP did win 26,820 votes in Badulla, easily over the 25,308 they needed to win a seat in 2020.</p><p name="93ee" id="93ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never has the JJB or any of its past reincarnations, won a seat in Badulla. However, in 2020 the seats allocated for Badulla increased from 8 to 9. And hence, Badulla was definetely “in play” for the JJB. Perhaps they didn’t take it seriously.</p><h4 name="dbac" id="dbac" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">8 Seats</h4><figure name="7e74" id="7e74" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*PthTvl8NwJGQz5g91Yer5Q.png" data-width="800" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PthTvl8NwJGQz5g91Yer5Q.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">JJB in Kurunegala (Source: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nuuuwan/sl-elections" data-href="https://observablehq.com/@nuuuwan/sl-elections" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://observablehq.com/@nuuuwan/sl-elections</a>)</figcaption></figure><p name="98e5" id="98e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The 8th seat would have come from Kurunegala, where the JJB won 36,290 votes, or 3.74%.</p><p name="ec52" id="ec52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">13,000 (+36%) more votes, would have won them a seat.</p><p name="c23d" id="c23d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In percentage terms, 13,000 more votes would have got the JJB to around 5% of the votes.

While Kalutara, Matara and Hambantota were probably lost, Badulla, Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, clearly had to be won. And with a very strong showing at that.</p><p name="f2e3" id="f2e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, both percentages and absolute votes to be won were not unreasonable numbers. Definitely within reach.</p><p name="3366" id="3366" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><h3 name="d67a" id="d67a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Appendix: Honourable Mentions</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="20a3" id="20a3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">11 Seats: </strong>Galle.

In both cases, the votes of the said party would go up. In the former case, the votes other parties would stay fixed. While in the latter case votes would go down.</p><p name="0bf3" id="0bf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I assume the former case. It makes for easier analysis, because we don’t have to assume how many votes the said party “stole” from other parties. Often, the “theft” is asymmetric. Regardless, for a smaller party like the JJB, the two cases lead to similar results.</p><p name="69ce" id="69ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* For simplicity, in this analysis, I’ve rounded-up the “more votes” to the nearest 100 votes.
