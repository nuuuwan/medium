You might say “yes” (or that you are “pro-choice”). Or you might say “no” (or “pro-life”). Or you might say, “sometimes”. Perhaps in particular situations. Say, when the mother’s life is at risk.</p><p name="9cbc" id="9cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Either way, this “where you stand” can be represented on a line. Or the spectrum. For example, if Alice is “pro-choice” and Bob is “pro-life”:</p><figure name="a2fe" id="a2fe" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*QvQjmabKgq8ypvPE12cQGQ.png" data-width="1092" data-height="416" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QvQjmabKgq8ypvPE12cQGQ.png"></figure><p name="1d44" id="1d44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What about “High Taxes on the Rich”? Again, we could represent “your stand” on a line. We could also represent both your views on Abortion and High Taxes on a two-dimensional (2-D) plane.</p><p name="f558" id="f558" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, suppose Alice supports both High Taxes and Abortion. Bob supports High Taxes, but not Abortion. Charlie supports neither High Taxes nor Abortion. And Debbie supports Abortion, but not High Taxes. We get the following “2-D plane”:</p><figure name="ea83" id="ea83" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WQ9tfPJLiNFuruBK9XVzgg.png" data-width="1040" data-height="992" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WQ9tfPJLiNFuruBK9XVzgg.png"></figure><h3 name="7ff2" id="7ff2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">1000-D</h3><p name="c183" id="c183" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Civics is complicated. It has many issues. Not just two, like Abortion and High Taxes. In reality, there are thousands of issues. From education, to immigration, to poverty. And citizens have (or should have) various opinions on these various issues.</p><p name="7203" id="7203" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we were to represent these issues on a diagram, we could need a new “dimension” for each issue. Now, it is easy to represent one issue on a “1-D” line. Or two issues on a “2-D” plane. We could even visualise three issues on a “3-D” cube. But beyond this, things get tricky. How might we draw a “4-D” or “5-D” diagram? And a political discourse with 1000 of issues would need a “1000-D” diagram.</p><p name="1107" id="1107" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we can’t visualise 1000-D on a diagram, we can represent it mathematically. Such a representation is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hypercube</a>.</p><p name="edab" id="edab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A hypercube could have any number (n) of dimensions. If n = 1, it is a line. If n = 2, it is a plane. If n = 3, it is a cube. As two (X, Y) numbers or “coordinates” represent a point on a 2-D plane, n numbers can represent a point on an “n-D” hypercube.</p><h3 name="a8d6" id="a8d6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Elephants and Donkeys</h3><p name="6633" id="6633" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let’s go back to our 2-D Hypercube. Suppose Alice, Bob, Charlie and Debbie, live in a country with two dominant political parties. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Now, what policies should these parties have on Abortion and High Taxes?</p><p name="d095" id="d095" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One option might be to consider a “middle-of-the-road” approach. Where the parties adoption the “average” view of the people. Another approach is that parties look at the most popular “locations” on the Hypercube, and adopt those as policies.</p><p name="cc88" id="cc88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, in the US, the Democratic Party has adopted a “Pro-Choice and High Taxes” view (like Alice). The Republican Party has adopted the polar-opposite “Pro-Life and Low Taxes” view (like Charlie).</p><figure name="6672" id="6672" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*E2LgwfjZUMRdJ7vhVxJZmA.png" data-width="1178" data-height="954" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E2LgwfjZUMRdJ7vhVxJZmA.png"></figure><p name="1598" id="1598" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What party do Bob and Debbie choose? Very often, voters sacrifice one view for another. For example, Debbie might feel that Low Taxes are more important for her, and vote for the Republicans. Bob, might conversely feel that High Taxes are more important and join the Democrats.</p><figure name="81d9" id="81d9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JGDDIn_hrRrAuR1bOzCZ1w.png" data-width="1300" data-height="1004" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JGDDIn_hrRrAuR1bOzCZ1w.png"></figure><p name="30d3" id="30d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Voters might have diverse views on diverse issues. But the existence of two dominant party identities leads to concentration in a few areas in the Hypercube.</p><p name="8643" id="8643" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this leads to an even deeper problem. Consider Bob. He has given up his “Pro-Life” views to join the Democratic Party. How does he justify this to himself?</p><p name="e4ec" id="e4ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What many voters end-up doing is to create a “belief system” that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“what the party believes is right”</strong>. This leads to belief systems that are based less on reason and thought, and more on authority and identity.</p><p name="74b7" id="74b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And since “the other” cannot be dismissed with reason and thought, it must be demonised with hatred and villification. “The other” is far worse than “rationally wrong”. “The other” is evil. Sub-human .</p><figure name="6893" id="6893" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6xfgsVCSZKfdm3eAdi3K_A.png" data-width="1296" data-height="610" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6xfgsVCSZKfdm3eAdi3K_A.png"></figure><p name="2b41" id="2b41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">And so we start with a hypercube that is infinitely diverse and complex. But sadly ends-up with a simple bi-pole of partisanship, hatred and evil.</p></div></div></section>
