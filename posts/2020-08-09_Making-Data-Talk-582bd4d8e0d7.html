Don’t let the data get the better of you</h3><p name="6726" id="6726" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After I shared maps of floating voters and bellwether polling divisions, many people concluded that campaigns should focus on either the bellwether areas. Or the areas with the highest density of floating voters.</p><p name="6752" id="6752" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This shows some fallacies in thinking.</p><p name="dd57" id="dd57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bellwethers are bellwethers not because they influence the national results in some way. It’s because their voter distributions happen to match the national distribution. The relationship is a correlation, not causation. So if a campaign targets a voter in Mawathagama , you might end up getting more votes in Mawathagama. But that won’t “cause” you to get more votes Islandwide.</p><p name="4f55" id="4f55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="ad3a" id="ad3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem with focussing on areas dense with floating voters is that causes you to lose out on other floating voters. The reality is that floating votes are everywhere. And concentrating on just some areas might win you polling divisions.
