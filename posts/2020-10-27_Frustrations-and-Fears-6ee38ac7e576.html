But why is it hard for us to say so openly? Why do we need to pretend we are the purest shade of Blue or Red? Democrats, please can you list Republican policies you agree more with?

I wish this was the other way around.</p><p name="15c7" id="15c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would have trusted the judgement of Ms. Clinton’s supporters (especially those around me) a lot more, had they articulated Ms. Clinton’s short-comings more clearly and openly. All political candidates must have some short-comings. When his/her supporters don’t say what these are, I can only conclude that they are either ignorant, or they have something to hide.</p><p name="71c7" id="71c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDemocracy%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1w9pINTsXis9dfoujthJMd5BqM83wBtKcd2CBM4IgULCTeLqu_ndcvzR0&amp;h=AT3sauH6NppmrezaWlgMnmcYHNGL7uktU6-vfpiRudQrJ1J18ISM0ab58nnKnGLkjYogPj29BQ4JaY2XFlA_RjYeCwLbH1eGqe66aR7T3ImuzA-AY6MQBUtjCMRiVqUjjZyX1rQ3" data-href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDemocracy%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1w9pINTsXis9dfoujthJMd5BqM83wBtKcd2CBM4IgULCTeLqu_ndcvzR0&amp;h=AT3sauH6NppmrezaWlgMnmcYHNGL7uktU6-vfpiRudQrJ1J18ISM0ab58nnKnGLkjYogPj29BQ4JaY2XFlA_RjYeCwLbH1eGqe66aR7T3ImuzA-AY6MQBUtjCMRiVqUjjZyX1rQ3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">democratic process</a> depends on people being informed and acting on that information. I, for one, had significant concerns about Ms. Clinton’s suitability, both as a Presidential candidate, and as a President (I don’t want to go into these, because that’s not what this note is about). But among fellow Bluer shades of Purple, I was in the minority, when it came to being open about these concerns.</p><h3 name="ca6b" id="ca6b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bigots casting stones at other Bigots</h3><p name="7c22" id="7c22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It is very hard for individual humans to hate other individual humans, once they get to know each other. The process of getting to know another person is the process of realizing that we are the same. On the other hand, it is very easy to hate labels: Mexicans, Muslims, Bigots, Misogynists, Homophobes, NRA-members etc etc, because it’s easier not to identify with them; and it’s easier to see the people cloaked in these labels as sub-human or inhuman.</p><p name="9902" id="9902" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been alarmed at the amount of political discourse which happens through labels. How many of us personally know a bigot? And if we think we do, have we ever sat down with the said bigot and tried to understand its views? Even if we conclude that the said bigot is seriously mentally disturbed and in need of therapy (or a lethal injection), can we extrapolate that large numbers of our fellow humans are exactly and uncontroversially the same?</p><p name="48e1" id="48e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A bigot is “a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions”. There is often very little difference between a bigot and someone who casts stones at others calling them bigots. People, please look in the mirror.</p><p name="83eb" id="83eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most people who voted for Mr. Trump are decent Americans. They are not bigots. For many of them the world has advanced and left them behind. They yearn for some past greatness, which an Orange faced, misogynist promises them. They did what they did because the rest of the world was too busy calling them bigots, rather that seeing their plight and helping them out.</p><figure name="8d8b" id="8d8b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*2_s7CQE5awTB0YxS" data-width="736" data-height="763" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2_s7CQE5awTB0YxS"></figure><h3 name="25a0" id="25a0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Conquer we must</h3><p name="aece" id="aece" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’ve grown to love the USA.

Ideas like “All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” must be protected and promoted. But I genuinely fear for them.</p><p name="aa12" id="aa12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I fear Blue Bigots as much as I fear that of Red ones. I fear personality cults of perfect leaders and perfect misleaders. I fear branding our fellow humans as inhuman. I fear all these things, but I’m most afraid that nothing will be done about them.
