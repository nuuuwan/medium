What it would take to get me out of a car and into a bus

Yet, I rarely travel by bus. A car (private or Taxi) is my usual mode of transport.</p><p name="cd73" id="cd73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And there are many car-holics like me. As of 2018, for every bus in Sri Lanka, there were almost <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.lk/Pocket%20Book/chap08.pdf" data-href="http://www.statistics.gov.lk/Pocket%20Book/chap08.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eight cars</a>. The problem is that cars, compared to busses, are far less efficient at using road space. A Tata LP 913 has about 3.5x more seats per area than a Toyota Prius. This misuse of road space is one of the top reasons for traffic congestion in Sri Lanka in general and Colombo in particular.</p><p name="ecc8" id="ecc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if we can convince these people (like me) to get out of cars and into busses? What if we could design a new bus system that these people would be happy to adopt?</p><p name="d42b" id="d42b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this article, I discuss a hypothetical bus system: Bus 2.0. The sort of system I’d be happy to use.</p><figure name="57d9" id="57d9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*BxKasbSzk5jTaaQ3_mUddw.png" data-width="1280" data-height="657" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BxKasbSzk5jTaaQ3_mUddw.png"></figure><h3 name="8477" id="8477" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Comfort</h3><h4 name="4fed" id="4fed" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Air Conditioning</h4><p name="460b" id="460b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The top reason I don’t travel by bus is because of Air Conditioning. Or, more accurately, because of the lack of it. In a city with 90<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">°</strong>F Temperatures and 90% Humidity, turning up to a meeting drenched in sweat is not an option. Hence, I revert to PickMe or Uber.</p><h4 name="67d2" id="67d2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Crowd Free</h4><p name="59f4" id="59f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A seat or a comfortable standing space, without foreign elbows is a must have for me. Regulation around “maximum passenger limits” would enable this.</p><h3 name="5a67" id="5a67" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Safety</h3><h4 name="1d94" id="1d94" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Harassment-free Busses</h4><p name="377a" id="377a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Busses in Sri Lanka are notorious for “Bus Perves”, who physically and verbally abuse, especially female passengers, particularly at times when busses are crowded. Pickpockets and other thieves are also not uncommon.</p><p name="abbd" id="abbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again “Maximum passenger limits” preventing over-crowding, would be a partial solution. Another might be to install security cameras on busses and use the footage to prosecute and shame miscreants.</p><h4 name="989a" id="989a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Bus Stops</h4><p name="2ab8" id="2ab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Many passenger accidents occur when busses are picking-up or dropping-off passengers; often because busses don’t stop at designated bus-stops, and instead stop (say) on the middle of the road. Or, even worse, not stop at all.</p><p name="e74a" id="e74a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As before, mandating and enforcing regulations on basic safety will solve this problem. Even with no rules or enforcement, Bus 2.0 could use these safety guidelines as a mechanism to differentiate itself from Bus 1.0, and hence build a customer base and brand.</p><h3 name="3551" id="3551" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The App”</h3><h4 name="1df0" id="1df0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Payments</h4><p name="60f9" id="60f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">People are far more likely to buy and use a product if they pay for it using cashless payment methods.</p><p name="3503" id="3503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A “Bus 2.0 App” that would enable payments would be simple to build, especially given that most rider and drivers will own a smartphone.</p><h4 name="fd8d" id="fd8d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tracking Stops</h4><p name="290c" id="290c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Beyond payments, a bus could easily provide other services. For example, it could warn the passenger that their destination is near, and alert the driver to stop; the modern version of the “bell” found on some busses.</p><h3 name="cd76" id="cd76" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Joint Ventures</h3><h4 name="7e05" id="7e05" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Niche Transport &amp; Tourism</h4><p name="8d57" id="8d57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In parallel to a “public transport” alternative, Bus 2.0 could also serve niches like office transport and school transport, by possibly going into joint-ventures with organizations or schools.</p><p name="c98b" id="c98b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another option is to use the system as a “Tourist Bus” system, particularly since many tourists sites around Colombo and its suburbs lie along existing bus routes.</p><h4 name="7b8d" id="7b8d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Ride-Sharing Apps</h4><p name="ff1f" id="ff1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Existing ride-sharing networks like PickMe and Uber could add Bus 2.0. Just as you pick a Tuk or a car, you could choose a Bus.</p><h3 name="3ddf" id="3ddf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Advertising and Publicity</h3><p name="bd62" id="bd62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As with most products, a little marketing could go a long way.</p><p name="8fd1" id="8fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bus 2.0 could market itself as “an environmentally friendly alternative to cars”, or “the most comfortable way to see Colombo” or “the safest way to travel” etc.</p><h3 name="700a" id="700a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Playing Devil’s Advocate</h3><h4 name="611f" id="611f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Cost</h4><p name="091d" id="091d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4">“But wait!” you ask. “Won’t AC busses with security cameras and passenger limits be expensive?”</p><p name="280d" id="280d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pricewise, we are not competing with the fares of existing busses. A journey that costs Rs.50 by regular bus (let’s call it Bus 1.0) might cost Rs. 1000 by car. Hence, a reasonable price for Bus 2.0 is probably in the range of Rs. 100 to 400 for this ride, and won’t need to compete at Rs.50.</p><p name="8a7f" id="8a7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This differential would give some “breathing space” cost-wise.</p><h4 name="d763" id="d763" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Bus Mafia</h4><p name="da38" id="da38" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4">“Sri Lanka’s Bus 1.0 is controlled by a (relatively) small collection of politically well-connected businessmen. Won’t they oppose Bus 2.0?”</p><p name="482b" id="482b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At least at the beginning, Bus 2.0 would look like Tourist or Office Bus services, which already operate fairly independently. Hence, at least initially, Bus 2.0 would not compete with the interests of Bus 1.0.</p><h4 name="1528" id="1528" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">More for the Rich</h4><p name="ed44" id="ed44" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4">“Why build another transport option for people who already have cars? Particularly when we could significantly improve Bus 1.0?”</p><p name="0006" id="0006" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">True. Bus 1.0 is hardly optimal. However, solving the problems of Bus 1.0 and Bus 2.0 are neither mutually exclusive nor zero-sum. Also, unlike Bus 1.0, which might need a government subsidy, Bus 2.0 can be self-funded.</p><h3 name="94c3" id="94c3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Thoughts on Next Steps</h3><p name="d96e" id="d96e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So what happens next?</p><p name="fe0b" id="fe0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Bus 2.0 might sound like “one grand plan”, it is a collection of much smaller plans; implementable independently and in parallel. Anyone interested in one of the parts could start working on that part(as I might do myself) knowing that they are contributing to the whole.</p><p name="1749" id="1749" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Bus 2.0 could also be, not a system, but a “Standard” for building systems. The implementation left to individual transport providers.</p></div></div></section>
