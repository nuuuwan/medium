Day and night, they go about their business silently, without complaining. And, all <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we </em>do is complain about them. Have you met anyone who has had a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">happy</em> traffic light story?</p><p name="333f" id="333f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One August afternoon, it was my turn to complain. The sun was directly above the red light, and the more I willed the light to change, the more my eyes burned in the sunlight.</p><p name="649b" id="649b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I stood arguing silently, I heard a sudden:</p><blockquote name="3d3e" id="3d3e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why, man, you there standing and farts sending?”</blockquote><p name="cacd" id="cacd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To my left was an old gentleman in a maroon shirt, dark trousers, and well-polished shoes. He was staring at the red light and didn’t see me.</p><p name="2bb0" id="2bb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then he turned his head, and his face changed from an irritated red to sheepish green.</p><p name="0a03" id="0a03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Almost immediately, a second old man, this time a little flatter in dress, but evidently the first man’s side-kick, joined us.</p><p name="6ac5" id="6ac5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first man’s gaze moved from me to the second man, and he redirected his previously misdirected admonitions to his friend:</p><blockquote name="328b" id="328b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why, man, you farts sending?”</blockquote><p name="819c" id="819c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The second man looked at both of us, once bewildered, twice embarrassed, and thrice indignant.</p><blockquote name="14b3" id="14b3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I farts sending not!”</blockquote><p name="c616" id="c616" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">As this important discussion took place, I remembered seeing both men crossing the road with me, as I crossed Alexandra place from ODEL towards Davatagaha Mosque. I remember pondering which crossing to take.</p><p name="79ce" id="79ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, Lipton Circus is a complicated intersection of six roads at two interconnected traffic roundabouts. It takes a bit of time to decide which crossing to take. To get from ODEL to Union Chemists, you need to cross two roads; from the General Hospital Outpatient Department, three. And if you make the wrong turn, four, even, five.</p><p name="c664" id="c664" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By this time a gaggle of students from Buddhist Ladies College had joined us and started giggling at so many mentions of “fart”. To make things worse, the second old man continued to protest with childlike dudgeon.</p><blockquote name="cd17" id="cd17" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I farts sending not! Sending not!”</blockquote><p name="26fa" id="26fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Finally, the traffic light, the root of all our sorrows, changed. We, farts and all, crossed the road.</p><p name="eebc" id="eebc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The two old men walked in the opposite direction, towards Paradise Road, evidently, taking their fart talk with them. I made my monthly visit to Union Chemists, handed my prescription to the attendant at the counter and waited. She returned momentarily with two plastic bottles, sniffing the air.</p><p name="6b90" id="6b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Several customers at ODEL had complained to my supervisor, and the nice lady doctor at the General Hospital Outpatient Department recommended doubling my dose.</p><p name="3972" id="3972" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked out, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Damn!”</em>, I said to myself. Another red light!</p><p name="e53c" id="e53c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="f413" id="f413" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[This is a work of fiction.
