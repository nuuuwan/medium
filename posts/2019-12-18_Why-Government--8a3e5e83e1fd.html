A zero here or there didn’t seem to make much of a difference. So I decided to make two adjustments.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1bc0" id="1bc0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">First, “convert” the numbers to “per person”.</li><li name="4d7f" id="4d7f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Second, to align things with how most “ordinary” people “budget”, convert the numbers to “per month”.</li></ul><p name="b34b" id="b34b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Assuming a population of 22,000,000, we get defence spending at Rs. 13,636 per person per year, or about Rs. 1,200 per person per month. Similarly,</p><figure name="3ab9" id="3ab9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*D8C4Xt0nPchTc6nVZgIFKw.png" data-width="2530" data-height="1248" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*D8C4Xt0nPchTc6nVZgIFKw.png"></figure><p name="700e" id="700e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This led to more questions. For example, would I be willing to forgo all the services that the Ministry of Health provided in exchange for Rs. 700 a month? Or stop using transport and highways for Rs. 910?</p><p name="c9eb" id="c9eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Was the government doing a good job, or could I pay someone else less and get more value for my money?</p><p name="2e63" id="2e63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pondering these questions, led to more questions on the “purpose of government”.</p><h3 name="2a55" id="2a55" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Big Government, Small Government</h3><p name="3d03" id="3d03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Almost everyone agrees that a country needs a government. But Many disagree, on its nature and size.</p><p name="3512" id="3512" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At one extreme, Libertarians argue for “Small Government”. Where governments are responsible for as little expenditure as possible. At the other extreme, Communists argue for “Big Government”. Where all spending is centrally planned and controlled.</p><p name="bf03" id="bf03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neither extreme seemed idea, so I thought of reasoning about each type of spending. One by one.</p><h3 name="50fc" id="50fc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Defence (Rs. 1,200 per month)</h3><p name="eccc" id="eccc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Like all things military, Defence is a hierarchical topic. A president of a country is usually also commander-in-chief. Unlike health, finance, or education, Defence is proportional to the size of a nation. A smaller state can be healthier, wealthier and wiser, than a bigger country. But a bigger country is almost always “stronger”. Defence-wise.</p><p name="34eb" id="34eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, in most cases, Defence is centralised. Centralisation is partly due to the need for control. It would be “inconvenient” if the governor of each province had to approve a country’s military action. It is also due to some “centralised values”. For example, protecting the “sovereignty” of a country is a goal of its defence forces. And sometimes “sovereignty” and decentralisation (e.g. “Federalism”) conflict.</p><p name="6e78" id="6e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, it would be almost impossible to think of Sri Lanka’s military organised at a provincial level.</p><p name="5030" id="5030" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, a few countries, like Switzerland, have a relatively decentralised defence system. Cantons have significant powers, especially with important decisions like declaring war. I wonder if more countries had decentralised defence systems, whether there would be fewer wars?</p><h3 name="adbf" id="adbf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Health (Rs. 700) and Education (Rs. 700)</h3><p name="11e0" id="11e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Unlike Defence, health and education can be decentralised. There are many private hospitals and schools in the country. However, these are mostly patronised by the wealthy. The majority relies on the state for free healthcare and education.</p><p name="53ac" id="53ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In theory, the central government could decentralise health and education entirely to local governments. And restrict itself, not to execution, but to only legislation.</p><p name="5873" id="5873" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In practice, it seems that the government performs a balancing act. Colombo and Moneragala could, in theory, run all their hospitals and schools. But in practice, Colombo has more resources than Moneragala, and hence could probably provide better services. By transferring resources from more affluent areas to poorer ones, the government ensures that everyone has some basic level of healthcare.</p><p name="2674" id="2674" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The principle or “value” behind this balancing seems to be “All Sri Lankans have the right to some level of healthcare and education”. Whether Colombo or Moneragala.</p><p name="1e1f" id="1e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But suppose you are a wealthy person. You can afford private hospitals and schools. Perhaps even international ones. Would you forgo government health and educational services? For Rs. 1,400 per month?</p><p name="8489" id="8489" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You might want your money back. But it isn’t that simple. You benefit indirectly in many other ways. For example, you might employ people who benefit from state education and healthcare. And if the government doesn’t ask your neighbour to clear his drains, you might suffer Dengue.</p><h3 name="c187" id="c187" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Highways (Rs. 660) and Transport (Rs. 250)</h3><p name="7429" id="7429" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most roads are maintained by local authorities, like municipal councils, urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas. If you live on a private road, it’s you and your neighbours who do the maintaining.</p><p name="5ce7" id="5ce7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what about large projects? Like expressways, new railway systems, and airports?</p><p name="a775" id="a775" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Highway and Transport Infrastructure and “infrastructure” in general, suffer from a paradox. “Infrastructure” almost always makes a loss in the short-term. Even in the longer-term, it usually makes a “measurable” loss. On the other hand, many believe that its “un-measurable” benefits out-weigh these “measurable” costs. For example, building and maintaining an expressway might cost a government billions. But it might also spur commerce and industry in locations accessible by the highway. And increase the country’s productivity as a whole.</p><h3 name="1085" id="1085" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Questions</h3><p name="f3d7" id="f3d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I still don’t know if I’m paying too much or too little for Defence, health, education, transport, highways, and manifest other things. But I’ll continue asking myself the following questions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="36c2" id="36c2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Why</strong> does the government provide some service? What <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">values</strong> lie behind their various roles?</li><li name="4516" id="4516" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is the government the <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">best party </strong>to provide that service?</li><li name="4764" id="4764" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If not, <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">who should</strong>?</li><li name="8f1b" id="8f1b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">If so, how might the government <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">do better</strong>?</li></ol></div></div></section>
