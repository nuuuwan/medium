Usually, it involves time. The “Permanent” thing endures unchanged across time.</p><p name="7afb" id="7afb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, a “Permanent Resident” has permanent home rights to some place. A “Permanent Secretary” never gets fired from a ministry. A “Permanent Art Collection” is a museum’s for eternity. At least in theory.</p><p name="f382" id="f382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In practice, whenever we talk of “Permanence” of a thing, we compare it to another thing. A “Permanent Resident” is permanent relative to a resident on (say) a temporary visa. The former is more permanent relative to the latter. But not in an absolute sense. A PR might lose their PR for (say) violating regulations. A “Permanent Secretary” never serves forever. In the end, they have to retire. In practice, permanent is not relative to eternity. But relative to the people in the ministry who are not permanent. Like a minister, or secretary of state, who changes with the government in power. A “Permanent Art Collection” is relative to those works that are (say) on loan.</p><p name="e19d" id="e19d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, it seems that “Permanence” is always relative to “Impermanence”. We don’t have a notion of the former not relative to the latter.</p><p name="9589" id="9589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then, where does time come in?</p><h3 name="11b9" id="11b9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Clock Time</h3><p name="5005" id="5005" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">All our notions of time involve an interplay of Permanence and Impermanence.</p><p name="774c" id="774c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, the earth revolves around the sun. This pattern is permanent. And from it, we derive our notion of a “year”. And we measure many impermanent things relative to the “year”. Our harvest might fail, but the earth will still circumlocute the sun.</p><p name="e60f" id="e60f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Day” is a similar concept. Even the Caesium Atomic Clock assumes that photons transition atoms in”permanent” patterns.</p><p name="3410" id="3410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what if these patterns are not absolute? We know they are not absolute. From Relativity Theory. But these “relative differences” are not detectable in practical life. We can’t perceive that a clock travelling at speed keeps different time to one at rest.</p><p name="da61" id="da61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But from experience, we know. That clock time seems to travel at different speeds at different “times”. When bored, time almost stops. When entertained, time runs at light speed.</p><h3 name="716b" id="716b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Psychological Time</h3><p name="ee56" id="ee56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We noted that “Permanence” is always relative to “Impermanence”. Hence, to see something as “Permanent”, we need to be aware of those other things that are “Impermanent”. The less change we observe, time slows down. More change and time speeds up.</p><p name="773e" id="773e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, when bored, nothing seems to happen. Or when nothing seems to happen, we bore. At these times, time stops. Conversely, when we are “entertained”, things are “happening”. And tempus fugit. Waiting for no man.</p><p name="5219" id="5219" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This alternative definition of time is not relative to “objective” phenomena. Like a revolving or rotating earth, or caesium atoms. It is purely subjective. Depending on what the observer observes.</p><p name="de07" id="de07" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Objective” clock time might seem “objective”. But there is a problem. All these “objective” things need to be subjectively observed. There is no “objective” way of observing “objective” things.</p><h3 name="08e2" id="08e2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Fantasies</h3><p name="fb3a" id="fb3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Imagine you’re sitting in a silent room. Nothing moves. Nothing sounds. Except for a clock. That ticks, and its second hand jumps in small increments. Nothing changes. Except for the clock.</p><p name="50eb" id="50eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if we remove the clock from the room? Does time stop?</p><p name="fad2" id="fad2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, imagine the opposite. Suppose you had super-human powers? Senses with which you could sense “everything”. To the movement of every subatomic particle.</p><p name="9498" id="9498" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That silent room would transform into a hive of activity. Between the ticks of the clock, there would be an infinity of happenings. And even that tick, that movement of the second hand, would not be a single event. But an infinity.</p><p name="31d9" id="31d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If such complete and perfect observation was possible, would time exist? Would permanence exist? Would ignorance exist?</p><figure name="5a1d" id="5a1d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oS0ehGXVYTnpFSyVC-uC2Q.jpeg" data-width="1080" data-height="675" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oS0ehGXVYTnpFSyVC-uC2Q.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
