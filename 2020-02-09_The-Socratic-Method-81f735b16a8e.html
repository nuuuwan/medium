Smart people have all the questions.</h4><h3 name="a11e" id="a11e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h4">My favourite meetings</h3><p name="a058" id="a058" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Like most people, I am not overly fond of meetings. But one type of meeting, I do like. One-on-ones. Meetings I have with one other person.</p><p name="36e8" id="36e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One-on-ones (1:1s for short) have many benefits. They can be had in informal settings. Like a cafe. Or a park bench. Or even while walking. “On the hoof”. They tend to be far more productive. Because the “agenda” must be relevant to both parties. Unlike most large meetings, where one, two or a few people talk. While others twiddle their thumbs, phones. Or sleep.</p><p name="700c" id="700c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But one of my favourite benefits of 1:1s is that they are the perfect setting for applying one of the most potent conversational tools: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Socratic Method</strong>.</p><p name="702f" id="702f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me demonstrate.</p><p name="1e42" id="1e42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suppose I’m having a 1:1 with an engineer that I’m mentoring. She says something like:</p><blockquote name="abd8" id="abd8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’d like to be a more productive coder. I’d like to be able to write more code in less time. How might I do that?”</blockquote><p name="3053" id="3053" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I could reply,</p><blockquote name="0410" id="0410" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Use a better IDE [Integrated Development Environment — a tool for writing programming code]. XYZ is excellent.”</blockquote><p name="a8a4" id="a8a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">or</p><blockquote name="b5a9" id="b5a9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You should master Git [A tool for maintaining multiple versions of code]. Here are a couple of tips…”</blockquote><p name="40d5" id="40d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">or</p><blockquote name="42a6" id="42a6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Here’s a reading list. Some great books on programming.”</blockquote><p name="5afb" id="5afb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">or</p><blockquote name="0b99" id="0b99" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Let’s do some pair programming [where one programmer codes and the other watches, observing possible mistakes or patterns]. Then, I’ll be able to suggest something.”</blockquote><p name="4663" id="4663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">or</p><blockquote name="4c73" id="4c73" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That office chair looks very uncomfortable. Get an ergonomic evaluation and a better posture”.</blockquote><p name="3639" id="3639" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">All of these are reasonable answers. But there is a problem. They are answers. But what, you might ask, is the problem with answers? Let me explain.</p><h3 name="9e8e" id="9e8e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem with Answers</h3><p name="57c9" id="57c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To start with, answering a question might be based on or lead to the assumption that the question has only one answer.</p><p name="0438" id="0438" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, my coding mentee might become obsessed about the perfect IDE. And forget about Git, programming books, pair-programming and posture.</p><p name="f9d8" id="f9d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But even if I caveat my answer with “this is one of many things you could do”, there is a more severe problem. When I answer a question with an answer, there is no “creation of knowledge”.</p><p name="9304" id="9304" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Knowledge passes from one person to another. Between us, there is no new knowledge. Even though one of us might now have more knowledge. The system as a whole, has not gained.</p><h3 name="fd1f" id="fd1f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Socratic Solution</h3><p name="7653" id="7653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Alternatively, I could have “answered” the question as follows:</p><blockquote name="ecda" id="ecda" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why do you want to write more code in a day?”</blockquote><p name="95ac" id="95ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">or</p><blockquote name="a6c0" id="a6c0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What makes you think you are not writing enough code?”</blockquote><p name="c414" id="c414" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">or</p><blockquote name="2d49" id="2d49" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How would you describe a “productive coder”?”</blockquote><p name="6d43" id="6d43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">When a question answers a question, there is an opportunity for “creating” knowledge. Or “expanding” knowledge.</p><p name="2f38" id="2f38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, I get a better sense of why my mentee wants to code more. Or anxieties she might have about not being a good enough coder. Or (possibly flawed) views and opinions she has on what makes a “productive coder”. The “correct answer” to her question might have nothing to do with writing more code. It might have something do to with writing smarter code. Or even nothing to do with code at all. The motivation behind the question might be about getting more respect from colleagues. Or a higher salary.</p><p name="af57" id="af57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And to my question, my mentee can reply with yet another question. The “Socratic Method” refers to this type of cooperative conversation. Based on questions and constructive argument.</p><p name="ce6e" id="ce6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Greek Philosopher Socrates loved asking questions. Especially from self-important dogmatists who believed they had all the answers. And he would follow one question with another question. Many of his interlocutors were annoyed by his behaviour. And dubbed him a “gadfly”. Many believed that they wanted to undermine his power.</p><p name="6a5c" id="6a5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In reality, Socrates had only one aim. He wanted to expand knowledge. But not just his, but the collective knowledge of all humanity.</p><figure name="a0bc" id="a0bc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*q-eNBoG6iSyUTbB6HCaI6A.jpeg" data-width="620" data-height="380" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*q-eNBoG6iSyUTbB6HCaI6A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">The Death of Socrates</strong> (French: La Mort de <strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Socrate</strong>) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787</figcaption></figure><h3 name="b84e" id="b84e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Anti-Patterns</h3><h4 name="2220" id="2220" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“Venerable Experts”</h4><p name="7142" id="7142" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Sadly, much of Sri Lankan discourse has a very anti-Socratic nature. We love authority and the opinions of authorities.</p><p name="3b9a" id="3b9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, I attended a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bhana</em> (Buddhist lecture). Where the lecturing monk was not only irrelevant but also inaccurate. I am sure many in attendance recognised these errors, but no one questioned anything. This is so ingrained in our culture that “saying no” to a Buddhist monk is considered taboo.</p><p name="1ca3" id="1ca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This basis extends to education in general. In primary and secondary school, the teacher is always right. In university, the lecturer or professor is. And in real life, we tend to believe anything experts tell us. Because they are “experts” or “professors” or “reverends” or “doctors”.</p><h4 name="a13a" id="a13a" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Paper Qualifications”</h4><p name="617a" id="617a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A common question in professional recruiting is:</p><blockquote name="595a" id="595a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Is this person suitable for the job?”</blockquote><p name="4efe" id="4efe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The easy way out is to look at their paper qualifications. “He has a Masters Degree. He must be good. We don’t have to interview him!”</p><p name="a23a" id="a23a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A more challenging course is to ask a question. Or to be exact, many questions. In the form of an interview. Sadly, many employers are unable to conduct an interview. That might see through dubious paper qualifications. Because they don’t know how to judge a good employee. So they default to the easy answer. “Do they have a degree? Yes! End of story”</p><h3 name="8f5e" id="8f5e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Concluding Questions</h3><p name="ff78" id="ff78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Should you use the Socratic method?</p><p name="6b2b" id="6b2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is the aphorism “Dumb people have all the answers. Smart people have all the questions” true?</p><p name="20c1" id="20c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll leave that as an exercise for you, dear reader. You could try answering it.</p><p name="ffe0" id="ffe0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Or better still ask a question.</p></div></div></section>
